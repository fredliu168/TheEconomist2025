        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">D</span><small>ONALD TRUMP</small> has once again set his sights on the World Health Organisation (<small>WHO</small>). On January 20th America&#8217;s newly inaugurated president signed an executive order signalling that his country would withdraw from the <small>UN</small> agency. The order cites the <small>WHO</small>&#8217;s mishandling of covid-19, failure to reform and lack of independence as reasons for withdrawal.</p><p>Mr Trump&#8217;s previous attempt to arrange America&#8217;s departure from the <small>WHO</small> began in July 2020, when he issued a similar order which his successor (and now predecessor) Joe Biden rescinded in January 2021. Withdrawal from the <small>WHO</small> requires a year&#8217;s notice to the <small>UN</small>. António Guterres, the <small>UN</small>&#8217;s secretary general, will therefore need to decide whether the new notification &#8220;unpauses&#8221; the old one, leaving only six months before it takes effect, or resets the clock back to a full 12 months.</p><p>There could be legal challenges, too. One may come from Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global-health law at Georgetown University who said on social media that the decision required congressional approval since it was Congress that put America in the <small>WHO</small> in the first place.</p><p>America has been a cornerstone of the <small>WHO</small> since its foundation in 1948&#8212;as it was previously of the Pan American Health Organisation, founded in 1902, which was folded into the <small>WHO</small> and became its western-hemisphere arm. But although it provides the organisation with $1.3bn a year, most of this is earmarked for specific programmes such as &#8220;polio&#8221; or &#8220;health emergencies&#8221; that it chooses to fund. America&#8217;s actual subscription for 2025 is just $126m&#8212;a minuscule fraction of the $1.7trn the federal government spends on health.</p><p>The <small>WHO</small> also collaborates with American agencies like the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (which, itself, has offices in 60 countries), the Food and Drug Administration (<small>FDA</small>) and the National Institutes of Health. Loss of this collaboration is more concerning for many inside the <small>WHO</small> than the loss of income.</p><p>Mr Trump has been keen to criticise the <small>WHO</small> for its response to the covid-19 pandemic. An independent inquiry requested by <small>UN</small> member countries did indeed find the organisation had been too slow to declare a public-health emergency, and that international alert systems (set by <small>UN</small> members, but within which it had to work) were not swift enough.</p><p>The inquiry also found, however, that February 2020 was a &#8220;lost month&#8221; for many countries&#8212;America not excepted&#8212;and that there was a failure by authorities all over the planet to take measures to halt the covid virus&#8217;s spread. Moreover, Mr Trump, who was president at the time, has been widely criticised elsewhere for playing down the severity of the virus in the outbreak&#8217;s early stages, along with failures to implement a national testing strategy or any national strategy at all. His administration also pushed the <small>FDA</small> to make a drug called hydroxychloroquine available on the back of flaky evidence that it helped, and even after it was tied to 87 deaths.</p><h3>WHO loves ya, baby?</h3><p>Nor would the <small>WHO</small> (and, by extension, the non-American world) be the only loser from the United States withdrawing. America itself would lose. Its absence would limit its access to global-health data such as those American drug firms use to help design annual flu vaccines. And it could also hurt in a way that even Mr Trump might find disturbing. Leaving the <small>WHO</small>&#8217;s councils would give China an opportunity to increase its soft power by presenting itself as the leader of efforts to keep the world healthy.</p><p class="end has-stop">This week&#8217;s executive order might not, though, be the end of the matter. As happened in 2020, it could be a prelude to negotiation. In 2020 Tedros Ghebreyesus, then and now the <small>WHO</small>&#8217;s director-general, told <i>The Economist</i> that America asked for concessions in order not to leave. On that occasion he felt unable to comply with them. However, if further negotiations are not on the cards, America&#8217;s departure would weaken the apparatus of global-health security and might sow the seeds of future outbreaks of disease from which it, too, would be at risk. </p>
