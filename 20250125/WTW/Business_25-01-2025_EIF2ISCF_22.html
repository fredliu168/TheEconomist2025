        <section class="article__body">
          <p>Donald Trump took no time to issue a gale of executive orders relating to business on his first day as president. He declared an <b>&#8220;energy emergency&#8221;</b> and terminated funding for renewables infrastructure under Joe Biden&#8217;s Green New Deal, ditched a goal that 50% of new cars in America should be electric, and resumed export applications for new liquefied natural-gas projects. Another order aims to expand the development of resources in Alaska.</p><p>Mr Trump also ordered a review of existing <b>trade</b> deals and said he would create an External Revenue Service to collect tariffs. He warned that he would levy tariffs of 10% on Chinese goods by February 1st (which is a lot lower than the 60% he had aired on the campaign trail) and reiterated his intention to impose import duties of up to 25% on goods from Canada and Mexico. &#8220;The European Union is very, very bad to us,&#8221; Mr Trump said, &#8220;so they&#8217;re going to be in for tariffs&#8221;, too. He also ripped up a global deal on corporate taxes.</p><p>Tariffs were also dangled as a further punishment to China if a deal cannot be reached on divesting <b>TikTok</b>. Mr Trump signed an order giving the video platform a 75-day reprieve in America. It had temporarily become inaccessible to its 170m American users on the last day of the Biden administration, after the Supreme Court decided that shutting TikTok down on national-security grounds was constitutional. Shou Zi Chew, TikTok&#8217;s chief executive, attended Mr Trump&#8217;s inauguration.</p><p>Sam Altman, Larry Ellison and Son Masayoshi, the bosses of Open<small>AI,</small> Oracle and SoftBank respectively, joined Mr Trump at the White House to announce a new project to build infrastructure in <b>artificial intelligence</b>. Named Stargate, the project aims to spend $100bn on such schemes, rising to $500bn over the coming years. Elon Musk, who has been in a long-standing feud with Open<small>AI</small>, claimed the companies didn&#8217;t have the money. That prompted a clash with Mr Altman, who said Mr Musk was &#8220;wrong&#8221;.</p><p>Google was reported to be investing another $1bn in <b>Anthropic</b>, a startup that has developed the Claude generative-<small>AI</small> models. Amazon is also collaborating with Anthropic to build Claude into its Alexa voice-command service.</p><h3>How green is your AI?</h3><p><b>Microsoft</b> reportedly secured carbon credits by paying to restore parts of Brazil&#8217;s forests, the latest attempt by a big tech company to offset the increasing amount of energy it is burning through because of the expansion of artificial-intelligence services. Microsoft&#8217;s carbon emissions in 2023 were 29% higher than in 2020.</p><p>In Britain the government forced Marcus Bokkerink out as chairman of the country&#8217;s <b> Competition and Markets Authority</b>, reportedly because the regulator is not considering economic growth in its deliberations. The <small>CMA&#8217;</small>s new interim head is Doug Gurr, who used to run Amazon&#8217;s British business.</p><p>Pod Point, a provider of charging points for <b>electric vehicles</b> in Britain, warned that weak demand for <small>EV</small>s would cause its annual revenues to be less than expected. The company&#8217;s share price plunged by 40%. It said the market for non-company-car <small>EV</small>s was &#8220;challenging&#8221; and that the government&#8217;s consultation on its planned zero-emission mandate for cars &#8220;could further increase near-term uncertainty&#8221;.</p><figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250125_WWC471.png"></div></figure><p>Another 19m subscribers joined <b>Netflix</b> in the final three months of 2024, the most ever for a quarter, taking its total membership base to 301m. The company stepped up its push into live-streaming in the period, broadcasting a boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul, and two National Football League games. It also launched new episodes of &#8220;Squid Game&#8221;, a wildly popular South Korean series, and &#8220;Carry-On&#8221;, a film thriller. Confident of its success, Netflix is increasing its subscription fees in America, raising the price of a standard ad-free plan from $15.49 to $17.99 a month.</p><p>America&#8217;s Federal Aviation Administration ordered SpaceX to suspend further launches of its <b>Starship</b> project after a rocket exploded minutes after taking off from its base in Texas. The accident caused dozens of airline flights to be delayed or diverted in order to avoid the rocket&#8217;s falling debris over the Carib bean and Atlantic. SpaceX is hoping to conduct at least 12 Starship tests this year, but that goal may now be in jeopardy.</p><h3>Shedding a few pounds</h3><p class="has-stop"><b>LVMH</b> overtook <b>Novo Nordisk</b> to become Europe&#8217;s most valuable company on the stockmarket, a crown the luxury-goods company last claimed in 2023. Novo Nordisk&#8217;s stock dropped after the body that oversees America&#8217;s Medicare programme added its Ozempic and Wegovy diabetes and weight-loss treatments to a list of drugs that will be subject to price negotiations.</p>
