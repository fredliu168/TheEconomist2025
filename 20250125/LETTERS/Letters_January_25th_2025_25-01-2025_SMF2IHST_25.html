        <section class="article__body">
          <h3>The process of deportation</h3><p><i>The Economist</i> argued that Donald Trump &#8220;will not be able to carry through his threat to deport 15m people&#8221;, in part because &#8220;shipping out such a huge number would be extraordinarily expensive&#8221; (&#8220;Donald the Deporter&#8221;, January 11th). That assertion is not unreasonable, given that the deportations will entail tracking down 15m people, taking them into custody, pushing them through deportation proceedings, and then forcing their native countries to accept their return. However, having served as senior counsellor to the secretary of homeland security in the first Trump administration I would challenge that premise.</p><p>Both sides of the immigration debate are largely in agreement that the overwhelming majority of illegal immigrants are here to work. Accordingly, if the opportunity to work and thereby earn that living is withdrawn, illegal immigrants who do not fear severe persecution in their homelands will largely self-deport so that they can support themselves and their families with more modest earnings.</p><p>American employers who hire foreign workers are required to complete form <small>I-9,</small> identifying the worker and his work eligibility. However, the form is stored at the workplace and only rarely reviewed by a government official. A regulation entitled <small>G-</small>Verify (government verification) was drafted under the first Trump administration and will almost certainly be given effect in the second. It would require that <small>I-9</small>s are filed online, resulting in the prompt discovery of unlawful workers.</p><p>Form <small>I-9</small> applies only to workers known by their employers to be foreign, and many undocumented workers may disguise that from their bosses, who in many cases are happy to go along. Fortunately, there is <small>E-</small>Verify legislation pending in Congress that would require online verification of each new employee&#8217;s Social Security number. The executive branch has within its power the option of verifying those numbers for current workers. I would also recommend a small financial reward to employees who disclose their employer&#8217;s failure to complete form <small>I-9.</small></p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>WILLIAM CHIP</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Washington,</i><small>DC</small></div></div><h3>Moderate drinking</h3><p>You suggested that moderate drinkers live longer than tee totallers because some tee totallers are &#8220;sick quitters&#8221; who wrecked their health with booze in the past (&#8220;Hard-liquor truths&#8221;, January 11th). This argument was first made in the 1980s and has been repeatedly disproved, most recently in a wide-ranging review from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine that found moderate drinkers have a 16% lower rate of all-cause mortality than lifetime abstainers, which you mentioned in your leader (&#8220;How to think about the demon drink&#8221;, January 11th).</p><p>One does not need to have blind faith in observational epidemiology to accept the truth of this. The review notes that randomised controlled trials have shown that &#8220;moderate drinking favourably affects <small>HDL</small> cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (<small>LDL</small>) cholesterol, and apolipoprotein <small>A-1&#8221;.</small> It would be remarkable if this did not lead to lower heart disease and stroke risk, and it is this that explains most of the longevity gains enjoyed by moderate drinkers.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>DR CHRISTOPHER SNOWDON</small></div><div class="letter-info__organisation">Institute of Economic Affairs</div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>London</i></div></div><h3>Perceptions matter</h3><p>Bagehot rightly laments a tendency for British politics to over-concentrate on what is or isn&#8217;t &#8220;a good look&#8221; (January 4th). Clearly, there is a jeopardy in prioritising perception and appearance over reality and actual policy. There is also the debate about the death (or rude health) of &#8220;deliverism&#8221;.</p><p>A Venn diagram provides a useful framework for tackling these overlapping tensions. To be effective, decision-making needs to consider what is acceptable (or a good look), what works (a good outcome) and what is deliverable (a good option). As a pollster, I recognise that sensitivity to perception shouldn&#8217;t trump policy or serve as a way of shouting down good ideas but equally, it should be seen as a vitally important ingredient of successful policymaking.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>BEN MARSHALL</small></div><div class="letter-info__title">Research director</div><div class="letter-info__organisation">Ipsos</div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>London</i></div></div><h3>Women in combat</h3><p>Women are better suited than men to certain key combat roles in the armed forces (&#8220;Women warriors and the war on woke&#8221;, January 11th). Our daughter served on intelligence missions with Army Rangers in Afghanistan in 2017 targeting some of the top leaders of al-Qaeda, Islamic State and the Taliban. The army trained such women because men could not interrogate females in conservative Muslim countries.</p><p>Night after night our daughter would accompany the Rangers on these combat operations, fast-roping out of helicopters, coming under enemy fire and hiking two miles to the target site under the cover of darkness. The women and children would then be sequestered in a separate building and searched for weapons before our daughter started her interrogations. The army would not send anyone on missions like these who could possibly compromise the operation because they lacked the physical or psychological capabilities.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>ANN MARSHMAN</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Kennebunk, Maine</i></div></div><h3>Fairy tales</h3><p>It may be true that until the 18th century there was no distinct children&#8217;s literature (&#8220;Grimm stuff&#8221;, January 11th). But Nicholas Orme&#8217;s wonderful book, &#8220;Tudor Children&#8221;, provides a wealth of information about the nursery rhymes, plays, songs, stories and books that children encountered in the Tudor era. Mr Orme traces children&#8217;s literature in England as far back as 1,000 years ago, to the school dialogues of Aelfric of Eynsham and Aelfric Bata. As early as the 15th century there are records of adults being interested in what children were reading.</p><p>During the Reformation, William Tyndale, among others, attacked popular literature, such as the tales of Robin Hood, for corrupting young people. Then, as now, children&#8217;s literature could &#8220;cause conniptions&#8221;.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>RICHARD WAUGAMAN</small></div><div class="letter-info__title">Clinical professor of psychiatry</div><div class="letter-info__organisation">Georgetown University</div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Washington,</i><small>DC</small></div></div><h3>Know your place</h3><p>Bartleby mused about the importance of hierarchies in business, such as the seating arrangements that identify the corporate pecking order (January 11th). The key measure of the pecking order used to be the company car. Whenever a new member of staff appeared, everyone would cluster around the windows to identify what vehicle he or she had been allocated. Whether it was a top of the range car or an economy model could imply several grades of importance.</p><p>I remember when a colleague&#8217;s car was upgraded with a sun roof at no extra charge. When the car arrived the car-pool manager said the sun-roof was an extra not available for my colleague&#8217;s grade in the company, and asked if it could be welded shut.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>DAVID SCOTT</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Port St Mary, Isle of Man</i></div></div><p>I never like to sit at the head of the table at a meeting, either too much deference or one is obliged to pick up the tab. And it&#8217;s always best to avoid the sniper&#8217;s seat at the distant corner. I like to sit somewhat to the right of the big boss, to indicate general supportiveness just short of grovelling obeisance.</p><div class="letter-info has-stop"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>DAVID LAND</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Edinburgh</i></div></div>
