          <p><span data-caps="initial">Y</span><small>OUNG PEOPLE</small> have always come to Ms Xia with questions about their relationships. Now they often ask the astrologer about their finances and job prospects, too. &#8220;People feel a sense of powerlessness,&#8221; says the 27-year-old from Changsha. She won&#8217;t give them definite answers about their future. But for 200 yuan ($27) per session, she will read their star signs and let them know when their luck might turn.</p><p>Such guidance is increasingly sought by young Chinese, who face a sluggish economy, a tight job market and intense competition in many aspects of life. &#8220;They don&#8217;t have hope,&#8221; says Chen Jinguo, a professor of philosophy and religion at Minzu University of China. To find some, many are turning to divination, spiritualism and superstition. These act as a &#8220;pressure-relief valve&#8221;, says Mr Chen.</p><p>Most of the action is happening online. An app called Cece&#8212;which offers horoscopes, tarot-card reading and fortune-telling&#8212;has been downloaded more than 15.5m times from Apple&#8217;s app store in China, according to Sensor Tower, a research firm. The number of monthly users has shot up in recent years (see chart). Another fortune-telling app, called Wenzhenbazi, has experienced a similar surge. On Bilibili, China&#8217;s version of YouTube, people have taken to using the word <i>jie</i> (receive) when responding to upbeat videos. By doing so, they hope to capture the positive energy.</p><figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250125_CNC469.png"></div></figure><p>Around 80% of Chinese under 30 have had their fortunes told, reports NetEase, an internet company. Apps are the most common forum, but the trend can also be seen in real life. &#8220;Metaphysical bars&#8221;, where drinks are served with a side of fortune-telling, are popular in Beijing. Streets devoted to psychics can be found in cities across China. In 2024 sales of 18-bead bracelets, known for luck, jumped 11-fold, year on year, according to data from <small>JD</small>.com, an e-commerce giant.</p><p>The Communist Party has long tried to rid itself of what it calls &#8220;feudal superstition&#8221;. Last year the Central Party School, a training academy for officials, expressed concern about the number of members and cadres &#8220;believing in ghosts and gods&#8221;. It tried to clarify the party&#8217;s restrictions by publishing a <small>Q</small>&amp; <small>A</small> on the matter. Occasionally participating in local folk customs or consulting a fortune-teller on a name for your baby? That&#8217;s fine. Spending a lot of time and money, especially public funds, on superstitious activities? Unacceptable.</p><p>The masses are also discouraged from embracing such practices. A notice issued by the city of Sanming in 2023 stated: &#8220;The public should improve their scientific literacy, enhance their psychological immunity to superstitious activities and not seek spiritual comfort through &#8216;fortune-telling&#8217; when encountering real setbacks.&#8221; Other cities have followed suit. Last year some local governments cracked down on the burning of fake money and other paper offerings to the dead during the annual grave-sweeping festival.</p><p class="end has-stop">State censors, with the help of internet firms, have tried to curb the spread of superstitious beliefs and divination services online. Search terms such as &#8220;astrology&#8221; and &#8220;fortune-telling&#8221; have been blocked on Taobao, an e-commerce market. But on Weibo, a social-media site, popular astro logers have accumulated tens of millions of followers. Some speak of playing a cat-and-mouse game with the authorities. A 24-year-old tarot-card reader in Shanghai jokes that she tries to divine her own fate&#8212;to see if jail time is in the offing. </p>
