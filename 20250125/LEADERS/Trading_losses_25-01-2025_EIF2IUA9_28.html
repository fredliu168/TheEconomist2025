        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">M</span><small>ORE THAN</small> 90 years ago Franklin Delano Roosevelt surveyed the wreckage of the Great Depression. He pointed to one of its causes: sky-high tariffs had put America on the &#8220;road to ruin&#8221; by inviting retaliation and suffocating investment. It took decades of global effort, led by America, to bring tariffs down and let commerce flourish again. It was a painful lesson, and one that President Donald Trump has not learned.</p><p>To investors&#8217; relief, Mr Trump refrained from slapping tariffs on all imports on his first day back in office. But make no mistake: the man who says &#8220;tariff&#8221; is the most beautiful word in the dictionary is eager to ratchet up protection. He sees tariffs as a means to achieve lots of objectives: shrink America&#8217;s trade deficit, rebuild its manufacturing might and generate a gusher of revenue for the government. On every count he is wrong.</p><figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250125_LDC477.png"></div></figure><p>Mr Trump&#8217;s deployment of tariffs in his first term did nothing to narrow America&#8217;s trade deficit. One reason is that they tend to strengthen the dollar. Tariffs reduce American demand for imported goods, leading to less demand for foreign currencies. But when fewer dollars are sold, the greenback&#8217;s value increases, which in turn depresses global demand for American exports. The result is that even as Americans buy less from the rest of the world, they also sell less to it.</p><p>The record of recent tariffs also proves that they do not magically create jobs in American factories. Manufacturing as a share of American employment has fallen since Mr Trump&#8217;s first tariffs went into effect. Companies in industries directly protected by tariffs during Mr Trump&#8217;s first administration&#8212;notably steel and aluminium&#8212;did indeed increase their revenues. But that gain came at the expense of the thousands of downstream companies that suffered from higher input costs.</p><p>In Mr Trump&#8217;s most feverish moments, he has talked about completely replacing income tax with tariffs. An &#8220;External Revenue Service&#8221; would ensure that foreigners, rather than hardworking Americans, foot the government&#8217;s bills. It is brilliant marketing, but nonsense. The cost of tariffs is mostly borne not by foreigners but by American consumers, through higher import prices (see Free exchange). And tariff revenues cannot come close to replacing income tax. Even if import levels were to remain constant, a 10% universal tariff would fund little more than a twentieth of the federal budget. In fact, imports would decline as higher tariffs raised their price.</p><p>The most optimistic assumption is that Mr Trump mainly wants to use tariffs as a negotiating tool. They could be a powerful one: America, as the world&#8217;s biggest market, has plenty of weight to throw around. But tariffs are just as likely to tie America in knots. Once implemented, they are hard to revoke, and their potency diminishes through repeated use. If, for instance, Mr Trump doubles down on tariffs against China because it blocks a sale of TikTok, will he then triple down because of its export of fentanyl precursors and quadruple down to counter its clout in the Panama Canal?</p><p class="end has-stop">Mr Trump and many of his supporters have taken to praising the late 19th century as the golden age for America&#8217;s economy, when high tariffs spurred vigorous growth. But that is not what happened. Scholars have found that tariffs sheltered less-productive companies and raised living costs. Other factors, including a growing population, the deepening rule of law and the success of non-traded goods, fuelled America&#8217;s growth. This may all sound technical and academic, but it matters. By misunderstanding history and economics, Mr Trump is steering America and the world back into a dead end. </p>
