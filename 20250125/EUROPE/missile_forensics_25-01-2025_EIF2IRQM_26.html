          <p><span data-caps="initial">T</span><small>HE BACK</small> of the Kyiv Scientific Research Institute of Forensic Expertise does not seem an unmissable attraction, especially on a damp winter morning. But for weapons experts and intelligence types, the place is a major draw. Fragments of Russian missiles, drones&#8212;some of them almost wholly intact&#8212;and artillery shells lie on the ground, overlooked by rows of Soviet-era apartment blocks.</p><p>Inside nearby shipping containers, Ukrainian researchers are dissecting the wreckage of the weapons with pliers and screwdrivers, and recording what they extract, especially components sourced from abroad. The catalogue, a sobering reminder of Russia&#8217;s ability to bypass Western sanctions, grows by the day. &#8220;Here is a block, Japanese, Sony company, here&#8217;s the Shahed launch button, Bosch,&#8221; says Andriy Kulchytskyi, the head of the laboratory. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a Chinese engine with a screw that says, Made in the <small>USA</small>.&#8221;</p><p>Some of the latest arrivals are charred bits of the Oreshnik, a new Russian missile, which the institute&#8217;s experts are cleaning and untangling. Russia fired the Oreshnik against Ukraine in November, the first known use of a multi-warhead weapon in combat. Vladimir Putin has since threatened to do so again, against Kyiv, boasting that Ukraine&#8217;s air defences are no match for the nuclear-capable missile. He bills the &#8220;hypersonic&#8221; Oreshnik as a new marvel of Russian technology. But its remains tell a different story. One part dates from 2017. Another, inside one of the missile&#8217;s warheads, dates to 2016. This would confirm suspicions that the Oreshnik is no more than a souped-up version of an older model, the <small>RS</small>-26 Rubezh inter mediate-range ballistic missile.</p><p>Rather than a major threat, the Oreshnik is a show of force, made with a Western audience in mind, and a reminder of Russia&#8217;s nuclear capacity. For Ukraine, a more pressing concern is the new Shahed-136 suicide drone, which Russia is now producing at home having previously relied on imports from Iran. To date, Ukraine has been able to divert or intercept more than 80% of the drones. Very few have managed to strike Kyiv&#8217;s centre. But the Shaheds are becoming more resistant to spoofing or jamming, Ukrainian engineers say.</p><p>Upgrades have also made the Shaheds faster, more manoeuvrable and capable of flying higher. A wake-up call came on January 1st, in one of the biggest drone attacks since the start of the invasion, when at least two Shaheds were able to breach Kyiv&#8217;s Pechersky district, home to the government quarter. One of them smashed into a building only 150 metres from the presidency building. Two people died.</p><p>The earlier Shaheds used <small>GPS</small> technology to navigate. Many of those now being used are packed with 4 <small>G</small> data modems and Ukrainian <small>SIM</small> cards, which allow them to travel using Ukrainian cell-phone towers, as well as Chinese satellite navigation antennas. This makes them more accurate and capable of dodging Ukrainian electronic-warfare (<small>EW</small>) defences. Recent reports indicate some may be equipped with artificial intelligence, which Russia hopes to use to launch autonomous drone salvos. &#8220;In the near future,&#8221; says Anatoly (not his real name), a Ukrainian engineer, &#8220;our <small>EW</small> systems may not be able to affect the flights of the Shaheds at all.&#8221;</p><p>He and others are also seeing an increase in the use of Russian parts. At the start of the war the Kalibr, one of Russia&#8217;s most destructive cruise missiles, used mostly Western electronic components. Today, most of what the researchers call the Kalibr&#8217;s &#8220;brains&#8221; come from Russia.</p><p>China is making up for the shortfall, says Anatoly. He picks up a servo motor found in a Russian <small>KAB</small> guided bomb, produced by a Chinese company but falsely labelled as German. &#8220;Almost everything you see here&#8221;, he says, &#8220;has a huge number of Chinese elements.&#8221; Western sanctions are always one step behind, he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s impossible to control what the Chinese have handed over to the Russians.&#8221;</p><p class="end has-stop">To Anatoly, the wreckage gathered in his lab is a treasure trove. His one complaint is that Ukraine does not have enough people to reverse-engineer some of the weapons Russia has been dropping on its cities. &#8220;Our main task is to technologically outpace the Russians,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But our best guys are in the trenches.&#8221; </p>
