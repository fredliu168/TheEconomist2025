        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">O</span><small>NE OF THE</small> biggest fears about Donald Trump&#8217;s approach to the economy was that he might try to undermine the Federal Reserve&#8217;s independence and press it to cut interest rates. Instead, the president has set himself an even more difficult challenge: persuading investors that market-determined rates should come down. Specifically, Mr Trump and senior members of his administration would like to bring down the yield on ten-year Treasury bonds. On February 26th it fell to its lowest level since early December (see chart). All going to plan? Not quite.</p><p>The Trump administration&#8217;s logic is straightforward. When the Fed decides to lower rates, what it is actually doing is reducing its target for overnight borrowing costs. But for many actors in the economy, the ten-year yield is more important and tangible, because it serves as a benchmark for everything from corporate bonds to mortgages. And long-term yields respond to economic conditions more broadly&#8212;not just to the Fed&#8217;s short-term target.</p><p>For Mr Trump&#8217;s team the focus on long-term yields raises two questions. The first is whether the White House has the ability to influence such yields. A range of variables feeds into bond pricing: long-run growth and inflation expectations, the economy&#8217;s productive potential and the government&#8217;s fiscal trajectory, which helps dictate the supply of and demand for its bonds. All are slow-moving. Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary, has argued that the Trump administration can bring down yields by lowering energy prices and streamlining regulation. In reality, any such changes will be incremental.</p><figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250301_FNC783.png"></div></figure><p>The second question may matter more: will Mr Trump&#8217;s emphasis on yields make the bond market more potent as a check on his agenda? Much has been made of Mr Trump&#8217;s sensitivity to the stockmarket: a brief swoon in equities earlier in February probably contributed to his decision to delay tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. Now, though, he appears to have also elevated the status of the bond market. Elon Musk, Mr Trump&#8217;s disrupter-in-chief, has done the same, saying that long-term yields will fall as his cost-cutting campaign bears fruit (a dubious claim).</p><p>Yields were always going to restrain Mr Trump, as they have done other leaders. James Carville, a strategist for Bill Clinton, famously quipped that he wanted to be reincarnated as the bond market so he could &#8220;intimidate everybody&#8221;. Yet the extra lip service paid to yields by Messrs Trump, Bessent and Musk has only cemented the market&#8217;s clout. Michael Medeiros of Wellington, an asset manager, says that he has &#8220;a lot more conviction&#8221; than he did before Mr Trump&#8217;s victory that the bond market will help discipline his policies.</p><p>There is circumstantial evidence bonds may already be having this sort of effect. In the two months after Mr Trump won, ten-year yields rose by half a percentage point to 4.8%, the highest in over a year. Optimism about growth was one driver; so was concern about the fiscal deficit. Were Mr Trump to deliver his promised tax cuts, he could shrink federal revenue by as much as $11trn over the next decade, or 3% of <small>GDP</small>, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a non-partisan group. That would exacerbate America&#8217;s already severe fiscal problems.</p><p>As Congress gets down to crafting tax laws, it has become evident that cuts will instead be curtailed. On February 19th Mr Trump voiced support for a &#8220;big beautiful bill&#8221; proposed by Republican leaders in the House of Representatives, which would cap cuts at $4.5trn over a decade. Although wrangling is still needed for legislation to make it through Congress and onto the president&#8217;s desk, the parameters are clear enough at this stage: Mr Trump&#8217;s tax-slashing plans are being watered down.</p><p>The bond market may also rebuff the wildest ideas batted about in Trumpworld. Stephen Miran, the president&#8217;s nominee to chair his Council of Economic Advisers, wrote a paper in November in which he suggested that America could compel other governments to swap shorter-term Treasuries for century bonds as a way to alleviate its debt burden. If such a policy were pursued, it would amount to a forced restructuring of American bonds. Sonal Desai of Franklin Templeton, another asset manager, says that even a hint that Mr Trump was seriously entertaining the proposal would bring out bond vigilantes. Until then, she dismisses the idea as &#8220;somewhere between clickbait and hysteria&#8221;.</p><p class="end has-stop">For now, the most pressing concern for investors and Mr Trump himself is why yields have fallen in the past month, and sharply in the past week. The president had hoped to achieve robust growth and disinflation&#8212;a mixture that could help push up stocks and bring down yields. Instead, signs of economic weakness have emerged, with consumers worried about the threat of tariffs, and enormous tax cuts now look unlikely. That is very much not what Mr Trump had in mind. </p>
