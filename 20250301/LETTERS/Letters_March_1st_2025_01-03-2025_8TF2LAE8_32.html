        <section class="article__body">
          <h3>A new defence strategy</h3><p>America&#8217;s technological edge in defence is definitely eroding, and its overly centralised procurement ecosystem is surely its Achilles heel (&#8220;Supremacy in jeopardy&#8221;, February 15th). A culture of conformity and complacency is not delivering value. Instead, the defence industry has persistently raised the costs for fewer exquisite platforms and undercut American deterrence. Your briefing captured the plodding pace of acquisition and the losing game that the leaders of the Pentagon have struggled to change. Policymakers fail to grasp the urgency of the problem, and if the underfunded Replicator programme is an example, they also do not recognise the scale of the defence dilemma.</p><p>However, I strongly disagree with the statement in your leader (&#8220;Battle for the Pentagon&#8221;, February 15th) that &#8220;America cannot focus on preparing for war in 2035 if that involves lowering its defences today.&#8221; This kind of thinking retards strategic adaptation, particularly the divestiture of expensive platforms (aircraft-carriers, <small>F-35</small> fighter aircraft and manned attack helicopters). If you realise that these systems do not really contribute much in 21st-century warfare, you could shift those resources without risk and accelerate the investment of capabilities for war in 2035.</p><p>Strategy is about trade-offs and risk. In an increasingly competitive strategic environment, America&#8217;s defence strategists need to discipline themselves to make those trade-offs or accept the continued erosion of credibility.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>DR FRANK HOFFMAN</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Fairfax, Virginia</i></div></div><p>Other areas ripe for reform are the National Security Act, which is in need of a major reorganisation to move the Pentagon from the 20th to the 21st century, and the National Defence Strategy. Technology alone will not fix the Pentagon. The starting-point must be strategy. The <small>NDS</small> cannot be executed in its aims to contain, compete, deter and, if war comes, prevail over a number of adversaries. It is not affordable and even if uncontrolled annual cost growth of 7-10% is funded, a flawed strategy negates what that money will buy. Moreover, though recruiting seems to have improved, the long-term outlook is not good.</p><p>Strategy without technology is as fatal as technology without strategy. Will we ever learn?</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>DR HARLAN ULLMAN</small></div><div class="letter-info__title">Senior adviser</div><div class="letter-info__organisation">Atlantic Council</div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Washington, DC</i></div></div><p>Whenever the subject of the defence-acquisition process arises, specifically the pork-barrel politics in Congress, I am reminded of the commissioning of the United States Navy&#8217;s original six frigates. Completed between 1797 and 1800, these frigates were built at six separate shipyards along the Atlantic coast, which added considerable expense. James McHenry, the secretary of war in the administrations of George Washington and John Adams, acknowledged the increased costs but argued this was to expedite their construction and delivery. The more cynical observer could conclude that this was to spread out the contract dollars.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>CHRIS GEAR</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Chicago</i></div></div><h3>A ship&#8217;s history</h3><p>Schumpeter (February 8th) stated that the <i>Exxon Valdez</i>, the tanker which caused the disastrous oil spill that fouled Alaska&#8217;s coastline in 1989, sank. In fact the <i>Exxon Valdez</i> never sank. It ran aground on a reef in Prince William Sound, spilling its oil. After repairs the vessel sailed for many more years, through numerous owners and name changes. She was eventually beached and dismantled in 2012 in India for scrap as the <i>Oriental Nicety</i>.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>ROBERT BERKLEY</small></div><div class="letter-info__title"><small>US</small> Navy captain (retired)</div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Lynchburg, Virginia</i></div></div><h3>Investing in Oxbridge</h3><p>It was great to see your article on how connecting Oxford and Cambridge could add £14bn ($18bn) a year to the British economy (&#8220;Build the Arc&#8221;, February 8th). I have invested in more than 20 startups with the Oxford Seed Fund. Beyond infrastructure, we need to change two things to unlock growth. The first is the name: don&#8217;t call it an Arc, call it a Flywheel. An arc is static, whereas encouraging risk and connectivity between these hubs will spill across Britain like a flywheel.</p><p>The second is intellectual property. If our <small>IP</small> practices are uncompetitive we will hold back or lose our most promising founders. Uncompetitive can mean university <small>IP</small> shares being too high or being prohibitively obscure. Walled gardens grow, but only so far. Opening up our walled gardens means taking a smaller and predictable slice, and changing how we speak about connecting the hubs to evoke cross-pollination across Britain.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>MICHAEL HUTSON</small></div><div class="letter-info__title">Oxford Seed Fund</div><div class="letter-info__organisation">Associate fellow, University of Oxford</div></div><h3>How to beat the scammers</h3><p>Thank you for educating readers about the proliferation of online scams (&#8220;Industrial-scale swindle&#8221;, February 8th). The best and least expensive way to beat scammers is to turn off your devices. Stay offline. Meet people in person. Invest or donate money to people and organisations that you meet only in person no matter what. We could do with an article looking at how to live a life without technological domination. For example, how to beat loneliness without a chatbot. We need more reports on groups and organisations&#8212;local, national and international&#8212;where people can meet people, volunteer and invest time to make value in their and other people&#8217;s lives.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>KORY SROCK</small></div><div class="letter-info__title">Computer Life Skills</div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Seattle</i></div></div><p>Poverty, lawlessness and war form the backbone of this criminal scamming corridor. A closely connected aspect is human trafficking. Indian software engineers duped by fraudulent online job offers in Cambodia and Laos have found themselves trapped in cybercrime compounds. Held hostage, these victims endured harrowing conditions and rescuing them became a significant challenge for Indian authorities.</p><p>India has also recently witnessed a massive scam known as &#8220;digital arrest&#8221;. In this scheme fraudsters posing as state officials target individuals, falsely accusing them of receiving a drug-laden consignment or being involved in generating pornography. Similar incidents have involved scammers contacting victims&#8217; families and friends, demanding money to &#8220;absolve&#8221; their loved ones of crimes they never committed. Scammers have something for everyone.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>A.R. KATTAMREDDY</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Kuopio, Finland</i></div></div><h3>Worshipping DEI</h3><p>The wordplay in titles is what makes <i>The Economist</i> distinctive. The headline &#8220;Vox populi, vox <small>DEI&#8221;</small> (February 8th) is exemplary in this regard, but readers might have missed its potential theological significance. The three social virtues of diversity, equity and inclusion, when reduced to the initials of <small>DEI</small>, happen to form the genitive case of the Latin word for God. What Donald Trump treats as a whipping boy may actually be &#8220;of God.&#8221;</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>PETER WYATT</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Magnetawan, Canada</i></div></div><h3>God and mammon</h3><p>The article looking at how TikTok became a religious pulpit (&#8220;What the flock&#8221;, February 8th) and the money that online ministers are charging reminded me of a quote from Lenny Bruce: &#8220;Never trust a preacher with more than two suits.&#8221;</p><div class="letter-info has-stop"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>CHARLES UBELL</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>San Francisco</i></div></div>
