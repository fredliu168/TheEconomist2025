          <p><span data-caps="initial">O</span><small>LDER COLLEAGUES</small> at this newspaper recall when Monday-morning meetings involved squeezing into the editor&#8217;s office at The Economist Tower. Standing by the doorway, stooped in thought, would be a modest man gently ready to pipe up to challenge conventional wisdom. And to offer big ideas.</p><p>John Parker had lots of them. He wrote sweepingly about the post-communist transformation of Europe and how China&#8217;s reforms would change history. He was an early observer of American polarisation. He had a genius for highlighting demographic megatrends: how to feed 9bn people by 2050, how cities keep reinventing themselves. He had a twinkly talent for capturing the zeitgeist, explaining, for example, why 2019 would be the year of the vegan.</p><p>As well as big ideas, he had big jobs, over a 45-year career that included an interlude as op-ed-page editor at the <i>Financial Times</i>. He opened <i>The Economist</i>&#8217;s Moscow bureau (covering Mikhail Gorbachev&#8217;s revolution), was our Washington bureau chief at the time of the attacks of September 11th 2001, and became Beijing bureau chief to explain the dramatic changes under Xi Jinping. Between front-line reporting were stints as editor for Europe, business, books, the environment and globalisation.</p><p class="end has-stop">Lately, John was an editor-at-large, living in Dorset with his wife Kerry, whom he met 37 years ago on the New York subway. He wrote&#8212;and eagerly rewrote&#8212;a course on international relations for Economist Education. At a time of global upheaval the world has, sadly, lost one of the people best able to interpret momentous change.</p>
