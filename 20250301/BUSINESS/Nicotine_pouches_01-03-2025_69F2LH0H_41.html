        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">W</span><small>HEN TUCKED</small> between lip and gum, a small white pouch of Zyn is intended to give the user a pleasant nicotine hit. Its maker is getting a lift, too. Shares in Philip Morris International (<small>PMI</small>), the world&#8217;s largest publicly traded tobacco company, are at record highs. Investors&#8217; enthusiasm, which has surged since a bumper earnings report in early February, has little to do with sales of Marlboro or <small>PMI</small>&#8217;s other cigarettes. It is fuelled by the firm&#8217;s booming &#8220;smoke-free&#8221; products (broadly, anything but burning tobacco)&#8212;and chiefly by Zyn.</p><p>In 2024 shipments of Zyn rose to 644m cans (of 15-20 nicotine pouches each), up by more than half from the year before. In America, where Zyn has become something of a <small>MAGA</small> favourite, <small>PMI</small> has struggled to keep up with demand. It plans to expand a factory in Kentucky and to build a new one in Colorado. In January America&#8217;s Food and Drug Administration (<small>FDA</small>) permitted Zyn to be marketed as being safer than cigarettes (though not risk-free).</p><p>There is much for investors to like about smoke-free products. Margins are fatter than for cigarettes, and widening. They also offer protection against an existential threat to tobacco companies: falling demand for their core product. Globally, tobacco use has plunged by about a quarter since 2010, thanks to health campaigns and stricter government policies. Some rich countries are even flirting with all-out bans. The attraction of alternatives that consumers like and regulators tolerate is clear.</p><p>Few tobacco companies have been as vocal as <small>PMI</small> in pursuing smoke-free products. Jacek Olczak, its chief executive, is full of bad things to say about smoking. He once recounted telling a hopeful suitor to ditch smoking or &#8220;you will never date my daughter.&#8221; The company has pledged to make two-thirds of its revenues from smoke-free sources by 2030. It chose to stay largely out of vapes, the industry&#8217;s main alternative to cigarettes, but says it has spent billions developing <small>IQOS</small>, a device that heats rather than burns tobacco. And in 2022 it spent $16bn on a majority stake in Swedish Match, Zyn&#8217;s inventor.</p><p>Might Zyn&#8217;s success become a source of trouble? Nicotine pouches are growing in popularity among teenagers. The latest National Youth Tobacco Survey reports that 1.8% of American middle- and high-school children (aged 11-18) have taken up the habit; only vaping, at 5.9%, was a more popular source of nicotine. &#8220;Zynfluencers&#8221; post videos of themselves using the pouches on TikTok. For now, the <small>FDA</small> seems relaxed. In January it said the risk to children using pouches did not outweigh the benefit to adults switching from cigarettes.</p><p class="end has-stop">Yet smoke-free products have brought big tobacco headaches before. In 2018 Altria, another big tobacco firm, snapped up a stake in Juul, then a leading vape-maker, for $12.8bn. Within four years Juul was nearly bankrupted by lawsuits blaming it for adding to the craze in vaping among the young. That should serve as a cautionary tale.</p>
