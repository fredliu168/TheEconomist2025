George Washington worshipped in one; the Massachusetts Constitution was debated in another. Like other venerable churches in America its pews have thinned out as religiosity has declined.</p><p>On a cold New England morning last Sunday young congregants at First Church told your correspondent that few of their friends are religious. But recent data shows they are part of a pause in trend. The share of Americans who identify as religious has levelled off, and this faith resilience has a surprising source: Gen Z.</p><figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250301_USC810.png"></div></figure><p>In 1972 some 90% of Americans said they were Christian, compared to a mere 5% saying they had no religious affiliation (researchers call them &#8220;the Nones&#8221;). By 2021 the Nones had swelled to 29%, a rise that was mostly consistent across lines of race, sex, income and education. On average, each successive birth cohort has been 10% less Christian than its predecessors.</p><p>But new data from the Pew Research Centre shows that Gen Z is about as religious as older peers. If Americans born between 2000 and 2006&#8212;a cohort at the heart of Gen Z&#8212;followed their predecessors, about 41% would identify as Christian. Instead Pew&#8217;s data shows that 46% do.</p><p class="end has-stop">Nearly three-quarters of Gen Z reports feeling lonely. Having just emerged from a service at First Church in Cambridge, 20-year-old Julia LaGrand says that she takes comfort in the fact that while friends may come and go &#8220;people in church don&#8217;t get to reject you.&#8221; For some of this isolated generation, church offers solace. </p>
