        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">T</span><small>HE CURE.</small> Dua Lipa. Ed Sheeran. Iggy Pop. Interpol. Katie Melua. Niall Horan. The National. On the face of it, these musical artists have little in common. But all have recently released a live album, a format whose glory days were thought to be long gone. The studio album&#8212;for which new work is carefully recorded in controlled conditions&#8212;is the big thing. The live album, usually a record of a particular concert or tour, is an afterthought.</p><p>That was not always the case. In the 1970s and 1980s, when rock music was at its peak, the live album afforded artists an opportunity to bottle the lightning that struck when they performed in front of a crowd. Kiss, Mot√∂rhead and Thin Lizzy all released successful live albums which showed off their frenetic style. Yet as pop and hip-hop became more influential, the live album became less so. (Both genres are heavily produced, meaning the best results generally come in the studio.)</p><p>So why the slew of live-album releases? A few artists claim artistic reasons. &#8220;A live album is edgier than studio work,&#8221; Ms Melua, a British singer-songwriter, says. &#8220;You only get one shot to deliver a performance.&#8221; For pop stars, sometimes accused of using autotune to polish their vocals, live performance is a way to prove their talent. On &#8220;Dua Lipa Live from the Royal Albert Hall&#8221;, the British singer showed her range by reimagining songs from her hit &#8220;Radical Optimism&#8221; album with orchestral arrangements.</p><p>Ms Melua suggests the pandemic has also played a role in the revival of live albums. For months, musicians were forced to cancel gigs; now that they are back on the schedule, both artists and their fans have a keener appreciation of live music.</p><p class="end has-stop">Concerts are occasions that fans want to remember&#8212;think of how many ticket stubs and zoomed-in videos are kept in drawers and on phones long after the event. A live album is a collector&#8217;s item in the same way. As such, the format benefits both fans and record labels. Acolytes get a means to relive the (probably expensive) experience. Record labels get the chance to charge them again for the pleasure.</p>
