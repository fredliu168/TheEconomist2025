          <p><b>BP&#8217;s</b> chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, unveiled a new strategy that he said would &#8220;fundamentally reset&#8221; the company&#8217;s direction away from green energy and back towards oil and gas. Investments in renewables will be cut by 70%. Mr Auchincloss said that <small>BP</small> had underestimated the resilience of demand for fossil fuels and overestimated the speed of the green-energy transition. He had been under pressure to switch direction from investors unhappy with <small>BP&#8217;</small>s inert share price. Elliott Management, an activist fund manager, has taken a 5% stake. <small>BP</small> says it is still committed to its sustainability goals.</p><p><b>Nvidia</b> produced another solid set of quarterly earnings. Revenue rose by 78%, year on year, to $39bn, and quarterly net profit surged to $22bn. Demand for its latest-generation Blackwell chips is &#8220;amazing&#8221;, said Jensen Huang, Nvidia&#8217;s chief executive.</p><p>A few weeks ago it was the hottest stock on Wall Street, but <b>Palantir&#8217;s</b> share price has fallen sharply of late, in part because of a new plan by Alex Karp, the boss of the software-analytics company, that will allow him to sell 10m shares over six months. Market speculation that cuts to defence spending in America will affect Palantir&#8217;s bottom line also hurt the stock. The Pentagon is one of Palantir&#8217;s biggest customers.</p><p><b>Apple</b> announced that it would invest $500bn in America over the next four years, create 20,000 jobs and open a new factory in Houston making <small>AI</small> servers. The announcement seemed to be aimed at seeking favour with the Trump administration. Apple has made similar declarations before, including in 2021, when it committed to spend $430bn in America over five years. Meanwhile, Apple&#8217;s shareholders voted against a proposal from a conservative investor to abolish the company&#8217;s diversity, equity and inclusion programme.</p><p>Upping the ante in competition between America and China, <b>Alibaba</b> made its own big declaration and said it would invest 380 billion yuan ($52bn) on <small>AI</small> and the cloud over three years, more than it has spent over the past decade.</p><h3>iSpy</h3><p>In Britain Apple took the controversial decision to disable its <b>Advanced Data Protection</b> tool for iCloud services. <small>ADP</small> offers end-to-end encryption, which prevents anyone except the user, Apple included, from unscrambling the data. Britain&#8217;s government had demanded Apple weaken the system to allow it access. Apple refused, and has instead withdrawn <small>ADP</small> from the British market.</p><p>In a surprise decision <b>Unilever</b> removed Hein Schumacher as chief executive after less than two years in the job, and replaced him with Fernando Fernandez, the chief financial officer. The consumer-goods conglomerate is under pressure from investors who want a faster pace of restructuring.</p><p><b>Thames Water</b>, a utility in Britain that is drowning in debt, reportedly asked <small>KKR,</small> a private-equity firm, and Castle Water, which provides water and sewage services to businesses and public bodies, to provide more details on their bids for the company. <small>CK</small> Infrastructure, which is based in Hong Kong, has offered to buy a majority stake in Thames Water, according to reports.</p><p><b>Prosus</b>, a global tech-investment company, boosted its food-delivery portfolio by agreeing to buy <b>Just Eat Takeaway</b>, which operates mostly in Europe, for &#8364;4.1bn ($4.3bn). Both companies have their headquarters in Amsterdam.</p><figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250301_WWC804.png"></div></figure><p>American <b>consumer confidence</b> fell sharply in February, in part because of expectations that inflation will rise over the coming months and increasing pessimism about the economy. The data suggest that Donald Trump&#8217;s trade war and his imposition of tariffs on even friendly trading partners is starting to worry consumers.</p><p><b>Coinbase</b>, a crypto exchange, said that the Securities and Exchange Commission had dropped its lawsuit against the firm for allegedly allowing trading in tokens that should have been classified as securities. The <small>SEC</small> also reportedly ended its investigation into the crypto business of Robinhood, a trading platform. The news comes amid a slump in crypto markets, despite Mr Trump&#8217;s crypto-friendliness.</p><h3>A recipe for disaster</h3><p class="has-stop">Five years ago Elon Musk warned that <b>Tesla&#8217;s</b> stock could be &#8220;crushed like a soufflé under a sledgehammer&#8221;. The carmaker&#8217;s share price has indeed tumbled this year, wiping out most of the gains it made after Donald Trump&#8217;s victory in November. Its long-awaited update this week of its autopilot software in China left investors unimpressed. And Europeans are turning away from its vehicles in droves. Tesla&#8217;s sales fell by half in Britain and the <small>EU</small> in January, year on year, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers&#8217; Association.</p>
