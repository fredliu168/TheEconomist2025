        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">F</span><small>OR THREE</small> years Ukraine has endured what was once unthinkable: an air-and-land assault on its capital; a bloody war of attrition; missiles; drones; glide bombs; summary executions. Now a new front has opened, this time, unexpectedly, from the West. Donald Trump&#8217;s brazen overtures towards Russia have publicly blindsided Ukraine&#8217;s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, who has begun to show his anger. On February 18th Mr Zelensky cancelled a long-planned trip to Saudi Arabia, saying he did not want to be associated with talks being held there without him: &#8220;We were not invited&#8230;It was a surprise for us, I think for many others as well.&#8221; On February 19th Mr Trump responded in kind, calling Mr Zelensky &#8220;a dictator&#8221;.</p><p>Mr Trump&#8217;s decision to talk to Vladimir Putin and his apparent desire to rehabilitate him have shocked Kyiv&#8217;s politicians. But few are truly surprised. &#8220;Our mental state was not good the day we heard the news,&#8221; says an <small>MP</small> from Mr Zelensky&#8217;s party. &#8220;But we were expecting it.&#8221; It was no secret that Ukraine&#8217;s representatives were finding doors in Washington slammed shut. &#8220;We understood the level to which Russian narratives have taken hold in America.&#8221; An opposition <small>MP</small> describes a sense of &#8220;foreboding&#8221; in parliament, as deputies brace for the prospect of having to vote for a humiliating ceasefire deal.</p><p>Even if Ukraine emerges from war, it faces a fight for survival. People&#8212;not just politicians and soldiers&#8212;are exhausted. Hundreds of thousands are dead or wounded. Millions have emigrated. Perhaps a third of the 4.3m Ukrainians who fled to Europe are under 18, many never to return. A deal without long-term security will push more parents to send their children abroad, worsening Ukraine&#8217;s already notable demographic malaise. &#8220;Peace is needed,&#8221; says a senior Ukrainian official. &#8220;We need peace. The question is&#8212;a peace that doesn&#8217;t finish us off at the same time.&#8221;</p><p>For all the turmoil, there is still nothing resembling a deal. But much is developing according to Ukraine&#8217;s worst-case scenario. Many of its elite fear the language coming from the Trump team echoes a Russian trap: calls for a ceasefire without security guarantees, and immediate elections that would shatter Ukrainian unity. &#8220;Mr Trump appears to want to get rid of Mr Zelensky, whom he has never liked and who he thinks is difficult,&#8221; says a former diplomat. &#8220;This is not about elections, it&#8217;s about getting rid of Zelensky.&#8221;</p><p>Mr Trump&#8217;s headlong approach will probably produce not so much a quick peace as an unacceptable offer to Ukraine. It will then fall to Mr Zelensky to draw the process out and, in that hiatus, negotiate. Unlike Mr Trump, Ukraine&#8217;s president has not revealed his red lines. A readiness to sit with &#8220;the killer&#8221;&#8212;Mr Putin&#8212;is compromise enough, he told <i>The Economist</i> last week. But he has said he will not agree to a ceasefire without security guarantees, or to any deal done behind his back.</p><h3>The tide is against</h3><p>In theory, Ukraine could fight on in defiance of a Trump deal. In practice, its hand will weaken with time. The war is brutal for both sides, but more so for the less numerous Ukrainians. Ukraine&#8217;s army has shown great skill at the unit level. But there are serious problems at the operational level and a notable absence of strategic planning. Front-line brigades are running out of men; some are operating with less than a third of their regular size.</p><p>Mr Trump, meanwhile, has many levers to pull to enforce a solution. He can&#8212;and may well&#8212;cut or stop military aid. He might unilaterally lift sanctions on Russia. He might drop other vital support, such as real-time targeting and Starlink, the backbone of Ukraine&#8217;s battlefield communications. There are workarounds, but turning those systems off would hurt Ukraine.</p><p>With Europe cut out of Mr Trump&#8217;s dealmaking, much now rides on Mr Zelensky and his will to fight. He has good reason to push back against harsh demands: his job and his place in history depend on it. But standing up to an American leader who thrives on defining himself by his enemies will be dangerous and psychologically tough. Insiders worry Mr Zelensky is retreating into a narrowing circle, just when he needs the broadest support. &#8220;There is no one who is ready to say no to him,&#8221; complains one, &#8220;and he is making mistakes.&#8221;</p><p>Many Ukrainians are clearly frustrated with their war leader, too. Opinion polling shown to <i>The Economist</i> suggests that he would lose an election by 30% to 65% to Valery Zaluzhny, his former top general, albeit that he has yet to enter politics. In January a public poll showed that trust in Mr Zelensky had fallen to 52%, the lowest during the war, well below the 90% who trusted him at the start of the invasion, though well above the 4% suggested by Mr Trump on February 18th.</p><p class="end has-stop">If all this seems perilous, it is not the worst-case scenario. The true Ukrainian nightmare would come from Mr Trump enforcing the Kremlin blueprint in its entirety: a ceasefire without effective security guarantees; elections that result in political paralysis, a weak presidency and a fractious parliament; then demobilisation, mass emigration and the beginning of social disintegration at home. The unity shown by Ukrainians in the early days of the war would be a distant memory. &#8220;This is far from an impossible scenario,&#8221; admits an official. &#8220;Remember there are millions of weapons in the country. You can even buy a captured Russian tank on the front lines for 100,000 hryvnia [$2,400].&#8221; </p>
