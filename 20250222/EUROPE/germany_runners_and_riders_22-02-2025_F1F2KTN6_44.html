        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">I</span><small>T HAS BEEN</small> a dramatic few months in Germany. November saw the collapse of the three-party coalition led by Olaf Scholz, triggering an early election that will take place on February 23rd. Then, last month, the campaign was given a jolt by the decision of Friedrich Merz, head of the opposition conservative Christian Democrats (<small>CDU</small>), to push anti-immigration motions through the Bundestag with support from the hard-right Alternative for Germany (<small>A</small>f<small>D</small>). For many, including hundreds of thousands that took to the streets in protest, Mr Merz had violated a long-standing taboo against working with extremists.</p><p>Yet you would not notice it from the polls. Apart from Die Linke (&#8220;The Left&#8221;), a small left-wing outfit enjoying a last-minute surge&#8212;perhaps in part because of Mr Merz&#8217;s stunt&#8212;every party sits within two percentage points of its score a year ago (see chart 1). Barring an unprecedented polling miss, the <small>CDU</small> and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (<small>CSU</small>), will win a clear victory. That means Mr Merz should take over as chancellor once he builds a coalition, probably in April or May. As for the <small>A</small>f<small>D,</small> its forecast share of 20% puts it on track to double its seat tally. Yet it is blocked from government by the &#8220;firewall&#8221; other parties maintain around it.</p><figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250222_EUC725.png"></div></figure><p>But Mr Merz cannot sleep easy. An interaction between Germany&#8217;s electoral rules, the anti-<small>A</small>f<small>D</small> firewall and the fragmentation of the vote has led to a curious situation in which tiny changes could have huge consequences for government formation. In most cases parties must win 5% of the national vote to enter the Bundestag. Three sit close to that threshold: the Free Democrats (<small>FDP</small>), a pro-business outfit ejected from government by Mr Scholz in November; the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (<small>BSW</small>), a left-conservative, pro-Russia outfit that broke away from Die Linke a year ago; and Die Linke itself.</p><p>So the Bundestag that emerges could have anything between four and seven parties (taking the <small>CDU</small> and <small>CSU</small> as one, see chart 2). The higher that number, the fewer seats for the larger parties and the trickier the coalition options for the <small>CDU</small>/<small>CSU</small>. Mr Merz will be watching the results for the small parties as closely as his own.</p><figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250222_EUC710.png"></div></figure><p>If none of them qualifies&#8212;unlikely, given Die Linke&#8217;s uptick&#8212;Mr Merz will almost certainly have a choice between Mr Scholz&#8217;s Social Democrats (<small>SPD</small>) or the Greens as coalition partner, as he also may if just one minnow makes it. Our election-forecast model shows a 22% chance he will find himself in this happy situation. With five parties in parliament, Mr Merz&#8217;s only viable two-way coalition may be with the <small>SPD</small>. A six-party Bundestag sharply increases the chance that three parties will be needed. And if all three tiddlers make it, a two-party coalition will be near-impossible. So complex is the situation that tactical voting to boost the chances of a particular outcome, often favoured by sophisticated voters, is like &#8220;playing 3<small>D</small> chess&#8221;, says Frieder Schmid at YouGov, a pollster.</p><p>Worryingly for Mr Merz, the Die Linke surge, and a smaller bump for the <small>FDP</small>, are squeezing his options. Our model finds a 37% (and growing) chance that neither a pairing of the <small>CDU</small>/ <small>CSU</small> with the <small>SPD</small> (a &#8220;grand coalition&#8221;) nor the Greens will win a majority. With the <small>A</small>f<small>D</small> out of bounds, that means Mr Merz would need two partners: either the <small>SPD</small> and the Greens in a so-called Kenya coalition, or a variation with the <small>FDP</small>, should it qualify. (The <small>CDU</small>/ <small>CSU</small> also shuns Die Linke and the <small>BSW</small>.) This might also apply if a two-party coalition would have only a tiny majority.</p><p>&#8220;If that happens,&#8221; sighs a <small>CDU</small> official, &#8220;we&#8217;re dead.&#8221; An ideologically messy three-party coalition could be a nightmare for Mr Merz&#8217;s hopes of restoring stability to German governance and predictability for Germany&#8217;s <small>EU</small> partners. Voters shudder at the prospect of another governing throuple, having despaired at the endless bickering of the <small>SPD</small>-Green-<small>FDP</small> &#8220;traffic-light&#8221; coalition. A second worry is that a three-way government could leave the <small>A</small>f<small>D</small> as the only meaningful opposition. A third is of a one-third &#8220;blocking minority&#8221; in the Bundestag that could thwart plans to relax Germany&#8217;s constitutional debt brake (see Finance &amp; economics section).</p><p>Germans will greet the next government with the stoniest of scepticism. Thorsten Faas, a political scientist at the Free University in Berlin, notes that this is the first election since records began in which every leading candidate has a negative approval rating (see chart 3). Just 25% of Germans say they are satisfied with Mr Merz.</p><p class="end has-stop">Having briefly harboured hopes of an absolute majority, his party is now on track for the second-worst result in its history. The <small>SPD</small>, his likeliest (and Germans&#8217; preferred) partner, will certainly chalk up its worst-ever score. A stagnant economy, a wave of deadly attacks by asylum-seekers and the chaos unleashed by the Trump administration have stoked the unease. There is a fog of uncertainty surrounding the post-election outcome. But that Mr Merz will enjoy no honeymoon is a dead cert. </p>
