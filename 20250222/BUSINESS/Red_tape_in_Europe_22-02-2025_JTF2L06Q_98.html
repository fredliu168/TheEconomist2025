          <p><span data-caps="initial">I</span><small>F RED TAPE</small> could be said to have a spiritual home, it would be the corridors of the European Commission in Brussels. The beating heart of the &#8220;regulatory superpower&#8221; that is the <small>EU</small>, it is there that the rules which guide how business is done in the 27 member states are made. The <small>EU</small> produced nearly 14,000 legal acts between 2019 and 2024. Perhaps not coincidentally the bloc&#8217;s economy has stalled. Bosses gripe about spending more time filling forms than filing patents. A plan to lessen their burden is expected to be released on February 26th. Hopes for radical deregulation, however, will have to wait.</p><p>Everybody agrees a dose of simplification is needed. That was one of the messages from a recent report by Mario Draghi, a former Italian prime minister, about how to stop European businesses falling behind international rivals. Each year European firms spend about &#8364;150bn ($156bn) on administrative costs. The commission wants to cut that by a quarter overall and by even more for small businesses.</p><p>To achieve this, cumbersome edicts will be made easier to comply with. That includes those that demand firms disclose their inner workings&#8212;whether goods were sourced ethically or in an environmentally sound way, say. At least three flagship laws will be watered down into one &#8220;omnibus&#8221; law, with the hope of cutting reporting requirements for firms. Several more &#8220;omnibus&#8221; laws are expected this year.</p><p>While the likes of Argentina, America and even India&#8212;whose &#8220;license raj&#8221; bureaucrats rival Europe&#8217;s in their passion for regulation&#8212;are slashing red tape willy-nilly, the <small>EU</small> is taking a more measured approach. The commissioner in charge, Valdis Dombrovskis, is not the chainsaw-wielding type. Europe &#8220;needs to maintain its high environmental and social standards&#8221;, he says. The preferred term for what is happening is &#8220;simplification&#8221; and not the more radical &#8220;deregulation&#8221;.</p><p>That is perhaps to spare the blushes of those who first suggested the edicts&#8212;often the same people who are now &#8220;simplifying&#8221; them. For whereas politicians elsewhere are scrapping decades-old laws, some of the regulations Europe is amending are so fresh they have not yet fully entered into force. Mr Dombrovskis admits a &#8220;protracted period of legislation&#8221; in recent years piled too much on to businesses. In particular, rules that were meant to apply only to big companies were in effect applied to their (smaller) suppliers.</p><p>Amending already-agreed texts will take time. The simplification push will need the approval of the European Parliament and the bloc&#8217;s member states. Some will take convincing. &#8220;There is no impact assessment that shows these texts are harmful to European competitiveness,&#8221; argues Pascal Canfin, a French liberal <small>MEP</small> who backed the original legislation.</p><p class="end has-stop">Businesses might be disappointed; many had been lobbying for a more complete overhaul. But some may find solace in the <small>EU&#8217;</small>s new Clean Industrial Deal, also due to be unveiled on the same day, in which the commission will suggest sops such as subsidised energy. If business can&#8217;t be made simpler, it can at least be made more profitable. </p>
