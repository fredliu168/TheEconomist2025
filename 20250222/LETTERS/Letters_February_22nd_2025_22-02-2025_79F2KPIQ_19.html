        <section class="article__body">
          <h3>Heathrow&#8217;s third runway</h3><p>To cope with an expanded Heathrow, steeper approaches by aircraft sound like a good idea, and they can theoretically be flown more efficiently and quietly (&#8220;Take-off&#8221;, February 1st). In practice, though, pilots often respond to a steeper approach by controlling their speed by using the speed brakes, which whistle.</p><p>You claimed that 40% of air pollution at Heathrow comes from ground vehicles. Maybe, but an <small>A380</small> uses around 70kg of fuel per minute to taxi, an equivalent fuel burn to around 1,000 cars driving at 30mph (48kph). For a highly efficient <small>A320</small>Neo the equivalent would still be over 100 cars. There are often 15-20 aircraft moving around the airfield at any time.</p><p>The biggest question comes down to design. Why does the runway need to be built over the London orbital motorway at one of the most critical points of Britain&#8217;s national road infrastructure? As a resident in Buckinghamshire who has watched a gold-plated high-speed rail project being tunnelled through the Chilterns at exorbitant cost, I wonder if we&#8217;re about to make the same mistake with Heathrow. Nearby Luton airport gets by with a 2,162 metre (7,093 feet) runway, a length that would fit without the complexity of building over a major motorway and be suitable for the significant proportion of short-haul aircraft operating routes from Heathrow.</p><p>As always there are trade-offs. On a shorter runway aircraft will use more thrust to take off generating more noise. But recent national infrastructure history would surely suggest that simpler, quicker and cheaper is the way to go.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>CAPTAIN GEOFF WILLIAMS</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire</i></div></div><p>It is understandable that Heathrow and other British airports in private ownership would wish to increase passenger numbers, revenues and profits. But this is not in the national interest in an era of decarbonisation.</p><p>The crucial fact is that most air travel is for leisure. Even at Heathrow, only around a quarter of passengers are travelling on business. There is therefore ample opportunity for business travel to increase, displacing leisure travellers to other London airports with spare capacity, and beyond.</p><p>This will happen through market forces because business travellers will pay a premium for the advantages of Heathrow. Eventually, all spare capacity at airports would be taken, and then the lowest value flights would be priced off, such as the weekend jaunts by stag and hen parties to convivial continental cities.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>DAVID METZ</small></div><div class="letter-info__title">Honorary professor, Centre for Transport Studies</div><div class="letter-info__organisation">University College London</div></div><h3>Mexico&#8217;s view of trade</h3><p>&#8220;Dealing with Donald&#8221; (February 8th) mentioned Mexico&#8217;s vision of a renewed opportunity for North America to deepen trade and economic integration. Take the trade in intermediate goods, where the average Mexican export is 40% made in the United States and the average Canadian export is 25% made in the <small>US.</small></p><p>As emerging economic competitors challenge established trade relationships worldwide, it is imperative that we present a unified front. The threat is not only to our industries and businesses but also to the economic security of our households.</p><p>The scale of economic competition today is unlike anything we have faced before. The rapid rise of <small>AI</small> and other transformative technologies raises the stakes even higher. By complementing our economies and ensuring that markets function efficiently, we can capitalise on our comparative advantages, boosting productivity and unlocking higher levels of shared prosperity.</p><p>A co-ordinated and competitive North America is the best path forward, ensuring opportunity and stability for all our citizens.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>LUIS ROSENDO GUTIÉRREZ</small></div><div class="letter-info__organisation">Undersecretary for foreign trade</div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Mexico City</i></div></div><h3>Why the Arctic is important</h3><p>Losing the Arctic sea ice might make business more profitable for the shipping and mining industries (&#8220;Break the ice&#8221;, January 25th). But it will cost the rest of the world dearly. Half of the Arctic&#8217;s reflective sea ice has already melted, and the strong multi-year ice is down to less than 5% of 1980s levels. If allowed to completely disappear, which may happen within decades, the loss of this reflectivity will add the equivalent of 25 years of carbon-dioxide emissions, further superheating our world toward disastrous climate tipping points in other natural systems.</p><p>We can limit these risks most effectively by reducing emissions of methane, hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants and other super climate pollutants. Lowering these emissions alongside carbon dioxide can avoid four times as much warming by 2050 as limiting carbon dioxide alone, substantially lowering the risk of losing Arctic sea ice.</p><p>It&#8217;s time we better understand the massive global costs, not just the narrower economic opportunities, that the loss of Arctic sea ice will bring.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>PAUL BLEDSOE</small></div><div class="letter-info__title">Professorial lecturer, Centre for Environmental Policy</div><div class="letter-info__organisation">American University</div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Washington,</i> <small>DC</small></div></div><h3>&#8220;The future is people&#8221;</h3><p>The transformation of parliamentary speeches into meaningless sound bites (&#8220;Rhetoric and reality&#8221;, February 8th) was set firmly on course by Tony Blair&#8217;s egregious spin doctor, Alastair Campbell. Simon Heffer recognised this sad fact by including in his &#8220;The Great British Speeches&#8221; Mr Blair&#8217;s address to the Labour Party Conference in 1999. It appears in the book as a cautionary example of what was anything but a great British speech. As Mr Heffer says, it was a product of the import of spin-doctors into Britain, &#8220;It is neither fine rhetoric nor does it feel well in any literary sense: it is a succession of slogans and brusque statements, issued one after the other, in the hope that they will penetrate the subconscious of the listener.&#8221;</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>PROFESSOR PETER SURTEES</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Bredasdorp, South Africa</i></div></div><p>You mentioned the empty press gallery as a symbol of Parliament&#8217;s declining relevance. This isn&#8217;t a new phenomenon. I remember sitting there in the early 1990s, when the Commons&#8217; speaker sent a doorman to poke me in the ribs. I had fallen conspicuously asleep during a debate. As I was the only journalist in the entire press gallery, it hadn&#8217;t gone unnoticed. It isn&#8217;t Parliament that is becoming suddenly irrelevant to British life, it is our current politics. Now that&#8217;s something to wake up to.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>CHRISTOPHER PHILIPSBORN</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Brighton</i></div></div><h3>A gem of a deal?</h3><p>The Free exchange column on the popularity of lab-grown diamonds (February 8th) sparked a spirited debate between my partner and I. As competition drives down the price of lab-grown diamonds these stones will lose their power to show commitment to a loved one through significant expense. Consequently, they&#8217;ll no longer serve as effective substitutes for natural diamonds, increasing the demand for the natural gems. So a wider price disparity with lab-grown alternatives actually boosts the narrative that natural diamonds are superior.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>ALEC DIETSCH</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Buffalo, New York</i></div></div><p>There is plenty of evidence to suggest that the size of a ring is inversely related to the success of a marriage. Another instance where size does not matter.</p><div class="letter-info has-stop"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>EBERHARD NEUTZ</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Laguna Beach, California</i></div></div>
