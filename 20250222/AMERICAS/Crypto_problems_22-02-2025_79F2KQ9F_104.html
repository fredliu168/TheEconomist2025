        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">J</span><small>AVIER MILEI</small> is facing his presidency&#8217;s first big scandal. On February 14th he posted on X, a social-media service, in praise of a cryptocurrency called $LIBRA, saying it would fund &#8220;small companies and Argentine ventures&#8221;. Thousands of people bought in over the next hour. The price surged from 21 cents at the time of Mr Milei&#8217;s post to peak at $5.54, then collapsed.</p><p>Most investors lost their shirts. Mr Milei deleted his post. By February 17th more than 100 criminal complaints had been filed against him alleging fraud. Argentina&#8217;s opposition party was calling for his impeachment.</p><p>The president has tried to distance himself from the project, insisting that his post did not constitute an endorsement. He has said he acted in good faith and was &#8220;not familiar with the details&#8221;. Awkwardly, his office says he routinely endorses businesses.</p><p>One of $LIBRA&#8217;s backers, a marketeer called Hayden Davis, was part of a team that launched a cryptocurrency promoted by Melania Trump, America&#8217;s First Lady, in January. That coin lost 90% of its value within days. On February 15th Mr Davis called himself &#8220;Javier Milei&#8217;s adviser&#8221; and said that he was &#8220;working with him and his team&#8221;. Mr Milei&#8217;s office has said the government has no connection to Mr Davis.</p><p>This was not Mr Milei&#8217;s first brush with crypto controversy. In 2021 he promoted a company called CoinX World on Instagram. It was later shut down by Argentine regulators.</p><p>It seems that insiders may have profited from prior knowledge of Mr Milei&#8217;s post. According to the <i>Buenos Aires Herald</i>, one wallet bought $1m of the coin at the exact moment of Mr Milei&#8217;s post. The wallet sold 45 minutes later, netting a profit of $8.5m.</p><p class="end has-stop">The president may have been emulating his idol, Donald Trump, who launched a cryptocurrency in January (its value also cratered). Mr Milei has also followed Mr Trump&#8217;s lead in announcing Argentina&#8217;s withdrawal from the World Health Organisation. He is mulling leaving the Paris climate accords. The $LIBRA saga shows that not all <small>MAGA</small> mimicry is a sure bet.</p>
