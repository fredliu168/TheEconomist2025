        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">I</span><small>N A DUSTY</small> desert in north-west Patagonia, a hulking rig is busy drilling. After plunging 3km underground, its drill turns and chomps horizontally for the same distance again. In Neuquén, the nearest city, boffins crunch data from the rig and keep its drill trained on an oil-rich sliver of shale, just five metres thick. Nearly 40 of these machines dot Vaca Muerta (&#8220;Dead Cow&#8221;), a vast shale patch in Argentina. The formation stretches from the Andes to the outskirts of Neuquén, where its dark layers peek through the sand.</p><p>Argentina holds the world&#8217;s fourth-largest reserves of shale oil and more shale gas than anywhere except China. Argentines started tapping Vaca Muerta around a decade ago. Production grew steadily. Then, a few years ago, it exploded. In 2024 Argentina exported more energy than it imported for the first time in 14 years.</p><p>This year Argentina is set to overtake Colombia, which produced nearly 800,000 barrels per day (b/d) last autumn, as South America&#8217;s third-biggest crude-oil producer. Only Venezuela, which produces nearly 1m b/d, and Brazil, which produces more than 3m b/d, will pump more. Javier Milei, Argentina&#8217;s libertarian president, calls Vaca Muerta a &#8220;panacea&#8221; and wants the country&#8217;s energy exporters to thrive. If they do, they could fuel his efforts to turn around decades of economic decline.</p><p>Argentina&#8217;s shale business faced steep odds. Drillers swoon over Vaca Muerta&#8217;s geology, likening it to the United States&#8217; richest formations. But as Vinicius Moraes of Wood Mackenzie, an energy-advisory firm, explains, &#8220;Argentina is a different beast.&#8221; Oil-price controls, export taxes and capital restrictions long made it hard to do business. Those policies, along with ageing conventional wells, caused oil production to wane during the 2000s. And in 2012 the decision by Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, then Argentina&#8217;s president, to nationalise <small>YPF</small>&#8212;an energy company owned by Repsol, a Spanish firm&#8212;spooked investors.</p><p>Still, enough money made its way into Argentina to foster a burgeoning shale business. Miguel Galuccio, who ran <small>YPF</small> from 2012 to 2016, persuaded foreign firms&#8212;including Chevron, an oil major&#8212;to invest in joint ventures. That may be partly because of the characteristics of shale drilling. As Francisco Monaldi of Rice University in Texas points out, shale production has low initial costs (compared, say, with setting up a big offshore operation), but needs sustained investment to drill new wells and keep production growing. Nationalising a shale project makes little sense for a cash-strapped government. &#8220;It&#8217;s like expropriating a carmaking company,&#8221; says Mr Monaldi. &#8220;It&#8217;s great at first, but the next day you have to work out how to keep making cars.&#8221;</p><p>For that reason, risk-conscious investors were willing to invest gradually. Over the past decade, shale-oil production has risen from around 20,000 b/d to nearly 450,000 b/d. Gas production has soared, too (see chart). <small>YPF</small>, alongside local drillers like Vista Energy (which Mr Galuccio now runs), has spurred more recent growth. &#8220;When we said Vaca Muerta could double production in five years, people thought we were crazy,&#8221; says Daniel Dreizzen, a former secretary for energy planning. Most analysts now reckon Vaca Muerta can produce more than 1m b/d by 2030.</p><figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250222_AMC484.png"></div></figure><p>The boom has transformed Neuquén. Vaca Muerta had been home to some conventional drilling since 1918. But by the mid-2000s output was falling. Shale gave Neuquén&#8217;s older oilmen a second shot and still draws new workers to the city each week. Gustavo Medele, the energy minister for Neuquén province, says a lorry driver can earn the equivalent of $3,000 a month (roughly double the average national monthly salary). Not everyone is happy. Some locals worry about the water used to break up compact shale formations. A mural near the city centre, showing a fire-spitting rig next to a river, declares: &#8220;Water is worth more than oil.&#8221;</p><h3>Mooing for the moolah</h3><p>Such criticism understates shale&#8217;s rewards. The boom could transform Argentina&#8217;s economy. Estimates suggest that the shale business could help create between a quarter and half a million jobs by the early 2030s. Widening the country&#8217;s trade surplus would replenish its meagre foreign-currency reserves, helping it pay its debts. Aleph Energy, a consultancy that Mr Dreizzen now runs, reckons that hydrocarbon exports could bring more than $30bn into Argentina every year from 2030. That would go a long way towards widening Argentina&#8217;s total trade surplus. Energy exports helped push it to $19bn in 2024, the highest figure in years.</p><p>Mr Milei&#8217;s reforms have already made business easier. Since last year, companies have no longer been obliged to reserve a certain level of supply for local refiners before they can export. The government has also stopped intervening in the oil market, letting the price of oil sold locally rise closer to that of Brent crude, the global benchmark. Shalemen long for the end of Argentina&#8217;s capital controls, which would make it easier to import kit and attract more foreign investment. But removing those is slower work.</p><p>Foreign cash will help Argentine exporters tackle their most pressing problem: infrastructure. Last year&#8217;s energy surplus was achieved by delivering gas to Chile, running oil pipelines at full tilt and sending the remaining barrels out of Vaca Muerta by lorry. An extra oil pipeline, due to open soon, will offer more capacity to send exports to Puerto Rosales, a city on the coast. Exporters are also ramping up gas supplies to Brazil, using old pipelines via Bolivia. But markets in neighbouring countries remain small compared with those in Asia and Europe.</p><figure class="media media--map media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250222_AMM918.png"></div></figure><p>And so to increase exports significantly, Argentina is looking farther afield. Several projects are under way, supported by tax breaks and other incentives that Mr Milei has carved out for big infrastructure investments. <small>YPF</small>, alongside other companies, is building an oil pipeline to carry 550,000 b/d to Punta Colorada, where a deep-water port will receive bigger tankers.</p><p>The firm also wants to ship liquefied natural gas (<small>LNG</small>) to Asia, where demand is expected to keep growing until at least the 2040s. The cost of the necessary infrastructure is immense, at some $50bn. But <small>YPF</small>, which has signed a deal to develop it with Shell, a British-Dutch major, is determined. Horacio Marín, its boss, has been touring Asia in search of orders; on January 21st three Indian companies said they were interested in taking shipments.</p><p class="end has-stop">Two things could derail Argentina&#8217;s progress, warns Mr Dreizzen. First, the coming wave of oil and gas production in the United States may push prices down, making <small>LNG</small> projects in particular less profitable and leaving Argentine producers with little room to compete. Second, if the country ended up in another economic crisis, foreign investors could panic. That would make expanding the country&#8217;s export infrastructure an even harder task. Milking Vaca Muerta for all it&#8217;s worth will not be easy. But it is already transforming the country. </p>
