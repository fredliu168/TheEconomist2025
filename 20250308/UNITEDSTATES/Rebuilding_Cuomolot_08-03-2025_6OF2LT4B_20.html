          <p><span data-caps="initial">P</span><small>OLITICAL DISGRACE</small> isn&#8217;t as constraining as it used to be. Andrew Cuomo, whose public career was thought to be dead just three years ago, is back in the spotlight as a candidate for mayor of New York City&#8212;and he is topping polls. Mr Cuomo resigned as governor of New York state in August 2021 amid multiple sexual-harassment allegations (which he denied). On March 1st he announced his comeback.</p><p>Mr Cuomo says New York City is in &#8220;crisis&#8221; and needs rescuing. The incumbent mayor, Eric Adams, was snared in a scandal over favour trading that ended with a humiliating intervention by President Donald Trump. Mr Adams&#8217;s slow-burn political downfall has certainly been disruptive. But the next mayor (almost certainly not Mr Adams, although he may run for re-election) will inherit a city that is doing passably just five years after covid-19 devastated its population and economy.</p><p>Despite a number of shocking assaults on subway riders, crime is declining; in 2024 murders hit a five-year low. (Other big cities, such as Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Detroit and Baltimore, also reported drops in homicides last year.) Shootings fell for a third straight year. Crime is down in public-housing developments and even in the transit system, in part because of the deployment of police on subways.</p><p>Tourists are back; in 2024 nearly 65m visitors arrived, the second-highest number in city history. Broadway is nearing pre-pandemic attendance. Young people still find New York exciting. Nearly 500,000 recent university graduates have moved to the Big Apple since 2021, according to the city&#8217;s economic-development corporation. Employment and labour-force participation are at all-time highs.</p><p>Remote work has hit New York&#8217;s commercial-property sector hard, although the picture has eased a little recently as companies demand that more workers come into the office more often. Top-line office buildings are recovering occupancy, but many others are struggling. Renovation and rezoning of office space in Manhattan&#8217;s central business districts are needed. Affordable housing remains elusive for working and middle-class New Yorkers. Record homelessness, rising evictions and widespread housing insecurity are adding to the anxiety. Mr Cuomo has not yet laid out a clear policy agenda, but his initial rhetoric touches upon real fears among some New Yorkers, who &#8220;try not to make eye contact with a mentally ill homeless person&#8221;, as Mr Cuomo put it. Worried they might get pushed off the platform, many subway users hug the station walls. The fears may be overblown but they reflect a prolonged failure of homelessness, mental-health and policing policies.</p><p>Before he entered the race, polls showed Mr Cuomo holding double-digit leads over likely rivals. But his victory in November is not a sure thing. He faces several candidates in June&#8217;s Democratic primary, which is where New York&#8217;s mayor will probably be chosen given the current weakness of the Republican Party in the city. The ranked-choice voting system, used in primaries, may be tricky for Mr Cuomo to navigate. A recent poll from Gotham Polling took the system into account and found Brad Lander, the progressive city comptroller, just beating Mr Cuomo. Candidates with a lot of negatives tend to do poorly in ranked-choice voting&#8212;and Mr Cuomo has a lot of negatives.</p><p>Besides the sexual-harassment allegations (he has 13 accusers), he has been dinged for abruptly disbanding a state commission investigating public corruption when it reportedly looked at groups close to him. Federal prosecutors brought charges against people involved in Mr Cuomo&#8217;s pet project, the Buffalo Billion, a plan to boost investment in that city. His administration understated the number of covid-related deaths in state nursing homes. &#8220;Did I make mistakes? Some painfully? Definitely, and I believe I learned from them and that I am a better person for it,&#8221; Mr Cuomo said in a campaign launch video. John Kaehny of Reinvent Albany, a government watchdog, says that Mr Cuomo claiming that he can fix a city undermined by Mr Adams&#8217;s ethical lapses is akin to an arsonist promising to fight fires.</p><p>There is no denying Mr Cuomo has experience. As well as nearly three terms as governor, he served one term as the state&#8217;s attorney-general and four years as Bill Clinton&#8217;s housing secretary. He was also enforcer for his late father, Mario, who was New York&#8217;s governor in the 1980s. Mr Cuomo&#8217;s swagger could help him manage Mr Trump. The president may dangle federal funding or even take it away, as he has already done; in February the federal government seized from the city&#8217;s coffers $80.5m of grants earmarked to cover part of the cost of housing migrants.</p><p class="end has-stop">Mr Cuomo said in his launch message that he has worked with Mr Trump in the past, and wants to co-operate. But &#8220;make no mistake,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I will stand up and fight for New York&#8221; to ensure the city gets its fair share of funding. New Yorkers tend to prefer mayors who are ambitious and ornery. In this respect the former governor is a clear front-runner. </p>
