          <p><span data-caps="initial">O</span><small>VER THE</small> next month or so, many Americans filing their tax returns have a new option. Instead of paying an accountant, or buying third-party software, they can log onto a government website, which will automatically input personal details of their wages earned and tax already withheld from the Internal Revenue Service&#8217;s data. The tool, called Direct File, is available this year to around 30m taxpayers in 25 states.</p><p>The creation of Direct File was in large part the work of 18 <small>F</small>, an in-house government tech consultancy. On March 1st Thomas Shedd, a former Tesla engineer who is the new head of the government&#8217;s larger Technology Transformation Services, in which 18 <small>F</small> is embedded, announced its abolition. Just weeks before, Mr Shedd had said the group&#8217;s employees represented &#8220;the gold standard&#8221; of tech in government.</p><p>The consultancy was created in 2014 after glitches hobbled the launch of Healthcare.Gov, the website intended to help Americans find health plans under Obamacare. The idea was to create a group of cross-agency tech experts able to modernise <small>IT</small> systems and improve procurement, says Christopher Whitaker, the director of the Alliance of Civic Technologists, a support network. Waldo Jaquith, a former employee, says he and three others once saved $500m in four days while working with the Department of Defence by identifying and cancelling a software project that was already being duplicated elsewhere.</p><p class="end has-stop">In some ways that makes 18 <small>F</small>&#8217;s work close to what Elon Musk&#8217;s &#8220;Department of Government Efficiency&#8221; claims to be doing. Its shut down, former employees say, suggests <small>DOGE</small>&#8217;s agenda is more about loyalty and ideology than efficiency. The consultancy had long attracted conservative ire. Its logo on X, Mr Musk&#8217;s social-media network, featured the transgender-rights pink and rainbow flag. On February 3rd Mr Musk claimed to have already &#8220;deleted&#8221; the group. One month later it is gone.</p>
