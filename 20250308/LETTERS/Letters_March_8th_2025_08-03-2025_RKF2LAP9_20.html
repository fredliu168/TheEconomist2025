        <section class="article__body">
          <h3>The great schism</h3><p>I disagree with your description of the recent differences between America and Europe as &#8220;Europe&#8217;s worst nightmare&#8221; (February 22nd). The combination of J.D. Vance&#8217;s direct and hard-hitting speech in Munich and the bizarre accusations of Donald Trump against Ukraine and Volodymyr Zelensky shows that Europe needs to stand on its own two feet. We should be honest and acknowledge that we have been warned. From American dismay at the Europeans&#8217; mishandling of the Libyan crisis in 2011 to Barack Obama&#8217;s strategic pivot to the Pacific in 2014, through the first Trump presidency and the threats not to defend countries that weren&#8217;t paying their defence dues, and on to the withdrawal from Afghanistan, America has been abundantly clear that it saw Europe as a rule-taker, not a rule-maker, and an unwelcome freeloader on American defence. That our purblind leaders somehow thought it was business as usual, even after Vladimir Putin&#8217;s aggression, is beggars belief.</p><p>So we are on our own. Good. We now have the necessary imperative to sort out our internal polities and use our economic muscle to rebuild national resilience, including defence. We can then reasonably expect to sit again at the top table. Alternatively, we can continue to fudge issues, to dodge hard choices and descend into further irrelevance and weakness, a truly dispiriting and terrifying prospect.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>SIMON DIGGINS</small></div><div class="letter-info__organisation">Colonel (retired)</div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire</i></div></div><p>Your leader calls for a &#8220;fiscal revolution&#8221; and for Europe to end its obsession with process and groupings and to appoint a single envoy to talk to Ukraine, Russia and America. My own experience of finding solutions for Europe in crisis is that the decision-making process of the European Union is not where the urgent focus should be right now. The need for unanimity blocks progress. It is not a country. The <small>EU</small> treaties are not equivalent to a fully sovereign state&#8217;s constitution. They grant significant powers to <small>EU</small> institutions but stop short of key attributes of state sovereignty, especially in fiscal, defence and social policy.</p><p>The entire <small>EU</small> budget is approximately 1% of the combined <small>GDP</small> of its members. The reality of its cumbersome, and at time fractious, decision-making processes does not lend itself to speed. The <small>EU</small> project should continue, and we should see more integration, not less. But the emergency we face in Europe on our collective defence must be dealt with by the European nation states in a forum, and with decision-making processes, outside the <small>EU</small> legal order.</p><p>Money is the key, and the <small>EU</small> was spectacularly successful in raising billions of euros to help member states during the financial crisis through the establishment of the European Stability Mechanism. This was an international organisation set up very quickly, under its own treaty outside that <small>EU</small> legal order.</p><p>I would suggest we start with something similar, with a coalition led by the countries with the biggest defence capabilities and including those smaller nations with the most to lose in the near term. Completion of <small>EU</small> capital markets and a banking union can wait.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>DAVID EATOUGH</small></div><div class="letter-info__organisation">Former member of the management board of the European Stability Mechanism, 2017-24</div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Luxembourg City</i></div></div><h3>Enforcing AI rules</h3><p>China&#8217;s DeepSeek has loosened America&#8217;s dominance of artificial intelligence and gives Europe a chance to catch up &#8220;if it can cast off its regulatory straitjacket&#8221;, you say (&#8220;The Paris discord&#8221;, February 15th). In fact, it is China, not Europe, that has the world&#8217;s most onerous <small>AI</small> regulation. China&#8217;s law on generative <small>AI,</small> for example, requires detailed information and prior permission before a model can be deployed. The rules are both more severe and are enforced much more robustly. So the lesson of DeepSeek is not, as J.D. Vance suggests, that safety standards hinder innovation. Europe&#8217;s problem is that it talks a fine game about rules but then fails to enforce them.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>JOHNNY RYAN</small></div><div class="letter-info__title">Director of Enforce</div><div class="letter-info__organisation">Irish Council for Civil Liberties</div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Dublin</i></div></div><p>Surely the history of how people have used the internet is the prologue for <small>AI.</small> Better selection of sexual partners, developing gambling strategies and personally tailored pornography. And just imagine how good the <small>AI-</small>generated funny cat videos will become.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>BILL HARTNELL</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Sydney</i></div></div><h3>Skills to build</h3><p>You quickly dismissed concerns that the British government&#8217;s development plans will not materialise because of a lack of capacity (&#8220;Plan it and the builders will come&#8221;, February 8th). It is true in construction that demand drives behaviour, and that a strong pipeline of projects will help attract workers. However, that logic alone belies the complexity of skills that we need in today&#8217;s industry. Programmes need diverse experience, from carbon-crunchers evaluating emissions and environmental impacts, to digital wizards capable of designing the technological backbones to keep projects on track.</p><p>These skills don&#8217;t just respond to demand but need to be nurtured and directed. That is why we don&#8217;t just need a pipeline, but a plan for construction skills as part of Labour&#8217;s industrial strategy. As you pointed out, a history of boom and bust has created a structural productivity problem in our industry. We will not break out of that cycle unless we can do things differently, bringing fresh thinking and different talents to bear. The government is the industry&#8217;s biggest customer and convener of our modernisation agenda. New skill sets are as fundamental to this as government is to our industry.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>PATRICIA MOORE</small></div><div class="letter-info__title"><small>UK</small> managing director</div><div class="letter-info__organisation">Turner &amp; Townsend</div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>London</i></div></div><h3>Closer than you think</h3><p>The Graphic detail on which countries provide the most support to Ukraine (February 18th) portrayed Japan as an anomaly for offering proportionally more support to Ukraine than France, Italy, or Spain, despite being farther from Moscow. However, the northern Japanese prefecture of Hokkaido is only about 25km (15 miles) from the Russian-controlled Kuril Islands, which are the subject of a territorial dispute with Japan.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>J. KRISTOFFER HOLMÉN</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Stockholm</i></div></div><h3>Some imaginative editing</h3><p>Contrary to the suggestion in &#8220;Puffed out&#8221; (February 8th), some book blurbs are indeed culled from impartial reviews. Your own review of a popular self-help book once described it as &#8220;mildly inspirational, if vague&#8221; (&#8220;Character-driven&#8221;, June 4th 2016). Only the word &#8220;inspirational&#8221; made it to the dust jacket.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>JEAN-MAXIME RIVIÉRE</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Berlin</i></div></div><h3>My two cents</h3><p>The baseline econometrics of Washington can, at times, be neo-Muskian, that is, somewhat spacey. Take the decision to stop producing the penny coin because it costs 3.7 cents to make (The world this week, February 15th). The production cost has little to do with the utility value of the penny, which passes hands thousands of times over decades. The present value of such financial insight may be penny-wise, pound-foolish. Indeed, a penny for Elon Musk&#8217;s thoughts may be a high-risk investment.</p><div class="letter-info has-stop"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>JIM BLAINE</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Wilton, North Carolina</i></div></div>
