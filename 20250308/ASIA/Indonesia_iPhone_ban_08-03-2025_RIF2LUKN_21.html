        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">I</span><small>T WAS BILLED</small> as a stand for &#8220;principles of fairness&#8221; against an uncaring foreign tech giant. Such was the heady rhetoric Indonesia&#8217;s ministers deployed throughout the country&#8217;s stand-off with Apple, which began in October, when Indonesia banned the sale of the newest iPhone. The saga reached a denouement on February 26th, with a $320m investment deal signed by Apple and the government.</p><p>The principle ostensibly at stake was the integrity of Indonesia&#8217;s local-content requirements (commonly referred to as <small>TKDN</small>). These mandate that phones sold in the country are made with at least 40% locally produced parts. Officials argued that phonemakers such as China&#8217;s Xiaomi and South Korea&#8217;s Samsung ran local factories to meet these requirements.</p><p>Yet for Apple, complying with <small>TKDN</small> by sourcing components within Indonesia was nearly impossible. It has just one supplier in Indonesia, Yageo Corp, a Taiwanese firm that makes ceramic capacitors, a basic electronic part. And compared with Xiaomi or Samsung, the stakes for Apple in Indonesia are smaller. Although sales are rising, the company sold 2.3m phones in Indonesia in 2023, 1% of global unit sales and 8% of &#8220;rest of Asia&#8221; sales (ie, outside China and Japan). The extent of business actually affected by the ban, which applied to the high-end iPhone 16, is even smaller.</p><p>Indonesia&#8217;s negotiating leverage was always modest. Few believed the government cared about precise adherence to <small>TKDN</small>. Even so, officials drove a hard bargain. After they rejected two investment offers worth $10m and $100m, Apple proposed a deal north of $1bn. It involved three parts. First, a factory would be built in Batam, an Indonesian island near Singapore, producing Apple&#8217;s AirTag accessory. Second, a separate &#8220;components and accessories&#8221; factory would be built in Bandung, a few hours from Jakarta. Third, Apple would further invest in its developer-training facilities in Indonesia.</p><p>In December Prabowo Subianto, the president, reportedly instructed negotiators to accept the $1bn offer, according to Bloomberg. But that deal failed to materialise. Despite Mr Prabowo&#8217;s go-ahead, Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita, the industry minister, rejected Apple&#8217;s offer in January. &#8220;Apple must understand&#8230;the Indonesian people are watching us,&#8221; Mr Agus said the day before rebuffing the company. The final $320m figure, announced by Mr Agus on February 26th, is less than a third of what Mr Prabowo had approved. Yet the details of the deal are remarkably similar to the original $1bn proposal. Factories are still to be built in Batam (making AirTags) and in Bandung (making mesh fabric for Apple&#8217;s over-ear headphones); training facilities will still be expanded. Half of the new deal will come through a woolly $160m commitment that Apple invests &#8220;hard cash&#8221; in Indonesia</p><p>It is possible that Apple&#8217;s original $1bn figure was exaggerated. In January the industry ministry said its valuation of Apple&#8217;s AirTag factory was &#8220;far below the $1bn commitment&#8221; and closer to $200m. Another possibility, given Indonesia&#8217;s unco-ordinated bureaucracy, is that Mr Agus was freelancing.</p><p class="end has-stop">Regardless, the episode demonstrates why <small>TKDN</small> is reviled. Rather than a systematic policy, it is an opportunity for politicians to make hay out of shaking down companies. This is damaging Indonesia&#8217;s position as an investment destination, especially compared with its neighbours. Apple itself illustrates this: against just one supplier in Indonesia, it has 19 in Malaysia, 24 in Thailand and 35 in Vietnam. Even after the expansion in Indonesia, Apple&#8217;s local footprint will remain small. In the end, it got the better deal. </p>
