        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">T</span><small>HE LEADER</small> of the free world basks on a sun lounger in his swimming shorts, sipping a beer next to the prime minister of Israel. Elon Musk dances on the beach, throwing banknotes into the air. A child carries a gold balloon bearing the likeness of Donald Trump, as a giant golden statue of the president towers over passers-by.</p><p>This fever dream of an American-occupied Gaza was brought to life in an <small>AI</small>-generated video that lit up on social media after Mr Trump shared it on February 26th. The 30-second clip, whose creator remains unknown, is slick in its production, outlandish in its content and hugely successful in its reach. Tens of thousands of people have &#8220;liked&#8221; Mr Trump&#8217;s post&#8212;and at least as many have hated it.</p><p>Much is made of <small>AI</small>&#8217;s potential to spread misinformation. The &#8220;Trump Gaza&#8221; video exemplifies a different use of the technology. Knowingly absurd, it is a high-fidelity provocation perfectly suited to tickle Mr Trump&#8217;s fans and bait his critics. No one is being fooled by the video, but it seems everyone is talking about it.</p><p>More communication of this kind can be expected for two reasons. One is technical. Until recently making a video like this would have required a team of professional animators. Today any amateur can have a go. Sora, Open <small>AI&#8217;</small>s video generator, was made available to Americans in December and launched in Europe on February 28th.</p><p>The democratisation of the technology was demonstrated by the speed of the response to the Trump video. Within 48 hours Palestinian activists had hit back with a professional-looking <small>AI</small> video of their own, &#8220;Gaza is Ours&#8221;, showing Mr Trump sobbing in prison as Gazans celebrated, backed by an <small>AI</small>-made rock song.</p><p>The second reason such clips will spread is political. Mr Trump and his allies delight in saying the unsayable and posting the unpostable, using humour for cover. Outrageous statements&#8212;in this case about Gaza&#8217;s future as an American-run beach resort&#8212;are given plausible deniability by the jokiness of the medium, even as the underlying message is conveyed to supporters. Expect other politicians to push boundaries in their posts.</p><p class="end has-stop">The left has traditionally led the way in mastering new media, aided by its generally younger, tech-savvy supporters. Barack Obama used Facebook to win the White House in 2008. Today America&#8217;s right is ahead. Mr Trump has cultivated a following among meme-sharing, crypto-trading techies, who are more gung-ho about <small>AI</small> than liberals, who fret about boring things like copyright and content &#8220;guardrails&#8221;. Britain&#8217;s leftish Labour Party released an <small>AI</small> video in January, only to be criticised by supporters for undermining the work of human creatives. Mr Trump&#8217;s antics may cause outrage. But if those on the left want to get even online, they too will have to seize the memes of production. </p>
