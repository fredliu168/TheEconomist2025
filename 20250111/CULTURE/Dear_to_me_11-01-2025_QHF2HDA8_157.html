        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">I</span><small>T LOOKED LIKE</small> a typical fish-and-chip shop. Aproned chefs tended to frying baskets and wrapped orders in newspaper. But the catch of the day came with a catch of its own: at Selfridges, a department store in London, patrons were buying toys rather than trawl. Cuddly cod were garnished with fuzzy lemons and served with plushy peas. The cheapest item cost $25, twice the cost of an actual meal. Jellycat, the British brand behind the pop-up shop, invited everyone to play with their food.</p><p>The world has gone soft for soft toys. On TikTok videos tagged #Plushies, featuring various stuffed creatures and objects, have been viewed around 8bn times. Stampedes have broken out at shops. The Jellycat pop-up required visitors to book a slot. Labubu dolls&#8212;elfin figures in fluffy outfits made by Pop Mart, a Chinese toy company&#8212;are popular across Asia.</p><p>Melissa Symonds of Circana, a consumer-insights firm, says that soft toys are the second-largest category in the British toy market; sales have increased by around 58% since 2021. The global market was worth almost $12bn in 2023 and is expected to grow at an annual rate of 8% until 2030. So lucrative are these playthings that Warren Buffett bought the parent com pany of Squishmallows, an American purveyor of rotund stuffed animals, in 2022, calling it a money-making &#8220;gem&#8221;.</p><p>It is not young kids driving the demand but &#8220;kidults&#8221; (those aged 12 and above). Kidults now account for over a quarter of sales and, in 2023, surpassed preschoolers for the first time as the biggest age cohort for toys overall.</p><p>The craze began during the pandemic, as teenagers and young adults, stuck at home amid a global upheaval, sought succour in cute playthings. Lucy Dray, the owner of an online soft-toy shop called Baby Beans, says that plushies &#8220;bring people happiness and comfort&#8221;&#8212;two states that &#8220;can be quite hard to find in the world we live in&#8221;. Pop psychologists on social media have also preached the benefits of reconnecting with your younger self. One influencer suggested that collecting luxury teddy bears was &#8220;healing [her] inner child&#8221;.</p><p>And as many defer having children until their late 20s or early 30s, kidults have more money to splurge on themselves. Soft toys are an everyday indulgence: you can spend anywhere between $10 and $250 on a Squishmallow. (Or, if you want a limited-edition black cat, you can buy one on eBay for more than $1,500.)</p><p>Collectors are not put off by such steep prices: if anything, they only add to the allure. Like obtaining a concert ticket or a sports trading card, getting your hands on a rare plushie gives you bragging rights. Celebrity endorsements have heightened their desirability further. Kim Kardashian and Lady Gaga are avowed fans.</p><p>Some will argue that the plushie craze is another sign of an &#8220;infantilised&#8221; generation. But trivial treasures have thrived in many eras. In the 1980s it was Cabbage Patch Kids; in the 1990s it was Beanie Babies. In due course &#8220;fading novelty could occur with specific toys&#8221;, says Dave Neale of Cambridge University, who studies games. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t see it as possible for play more generally because it&#8217;s so broad and varied.&#8221;</p><p class="end has-stop">For the time being, plushies are staying put in bedrooms everywhere. When Paco the Salamander, a toy influencer, joked on TikTok that she was &#8220;ready to grow up&#8221; and get rid of her sizeable plushie collection, her follow ers insisted that &#8220;you&#8217;re never too old&#8221; to own them. For toymakers, it is all about the soft sell. </p>
