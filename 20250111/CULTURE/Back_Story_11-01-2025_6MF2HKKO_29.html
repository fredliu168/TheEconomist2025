        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">A</span><small>T THE END</small> of &#8220;The Tempest&#8221;, Prospero steps forward to solicit applause. Shakespeare&#8217;s magician will be marooned on her island, unless she is freed &#8220;with the help of your good hands&#8221;, pleads Sigourney Weaver in a cross-dressed production at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane in London. The film star is a bland passenger in a play her character should command. Yet, on cue, the audience rises as one to acclaim her.</p><p>These days, they all do, even when the show is a dud. Back Story saw three plays of wildly varying quality in London over the holidays, each culminating in a knee-jerk standing ovation. This trend has been gathering for decades but in the past few years has conclusively swept the West End. The irrational exuberance&#8212;baleful to some observers, harmless to others&#8212;reflects changes in the mood outside the theatre as much as the drama within.</p><p>Standing ovations come in two sorts, the spontaneous and the staged. The unplanned kind can be powerful, even reckless expressions of feeling. Think of the indignant crowds which in 1997 stood to cheer Earl Spencer&#8217;s eulogy for Princess Diana, with its digs at the British media and royal family. &#8220;Who organised the standing ovation?&#8221; asked ever-paranoid Josef Stalin after an audience in Moscow rose in appreciation of Anna Akhmatova, a dauntless poet.</p><p>In London theatres, standing ovations were once remarkable and rare. Even when a few enthusiasts got up to honour great performances, they were typically left exposed by the doggedly seated majority. When Dustin Hoffman starred in &#8220;The Merchant of Venice&#8221; in the West End in 1989, the audience bestirred itself only on the night he announced the death of Laurence Olivier. &#8220;You have to die, you have to fucking die,&#8221; Mr Hoffman reputedly growled. Now the ovation seems part of the script.</p><p>Why? It&#8217;s a crossover from <small>TV</small> talent shows, runs one analysis, on which studio audiences are out of their seats with aerobic regularity. Alternatively, blame Broadway, which succumbed to the same tendency years ago and has exported it to London (and, say locals, to Berlin). The standing ovation &#8220;has become a reflexive social gesture, like shaking hands with the host at the end of a party&#8221;, griped a critic at the <i>New York Times</i> in 2012.</p><p>Rocketing ticket prices are part of the story, too. Forking out a small fortune ought to make people more demanding. Instead, through a process of auto-suggestion, many seem determined to vindicate their outlay by having the time of their lives (the ecstasies at &#8220;Hamilton&#8221; epitom ised this syndrome). The routine casting of celebrities is another factor. Fans of &#8220;Alien&#8221; who splash out on &#8220;The Tempest&#8221; may be keener on seeing Ms Weaver in the flesh than on critiquing her blank verse.</p><p>But, in London at least, the real turning-point was the pandemic. The punters who returned to reopened theatres from 2021 have behaved differently from their forebears. A few go in for raucous behaviour that miffs traditionalists, from singing and dancing to boozing and fighting. Many were so thrilled by the rebirth of live performance that they leapt up in elation. The habit has stuck.</p><p>Ovation inflation troubles aficionados for two reasons. First, it is coercive. Social scientists have studied standing ovations as examples of group decision-making and game theory in action. As the vertical momentum builds, the peer pressure becomes hard to resist. If you stubbornly sit out the curtain call, you look like a curmudgeon, and moreover can no longer see the cast.</p><p>Second, when standing ovations are ubiquitous, they are meaningless&#8212;an empty ritual rather than a benign insurrection, like the indiscriminate euphoria at film premieres or the partisan raptures at state-of-the-union speeches. In the grumpiest view, ovation inflation is part of a wider culture of incontinent overpraising, in which standards are ditched and hype conquers discernment. An unearned ovation is less a salute to the actors&#8217; craft than to the audience itself for being there.</p><p class="end has-stop">All true. Still, a bit of self-congratulation may be a permissible indulgence in a gloomy world. Decorum can be overrated; communal whooping is a harmless catharsis. And the post-pandemic cherishing of theatre is deserved: at its best it is indeed a form of magic, a nightly alchemy of art and imagination. If the spell fails, word always seeps out. Lots of tickets for &#8220;The Tempest&#8221; remain unsold. Its audiences may be rising dutifully to their feet, but other theatre-goers are voting with theirs.</p>
