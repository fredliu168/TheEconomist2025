          <div class="book-info"><span class="book-info__title">The Troublemaker.</span><span class="book-info__author">By Mark Clifford.</span><span class="book-info__publisher">Free Press; 288 pages; $28.99 and £20</span></div><h3></h3><p><span data-caps="initial">S</span><small>PECTATORS MIGHT</small> have expected him to be dispirited. But Jimmy Lai grinned from the stand in late November 2024; spotting loved ones in the public gallery, he waved and blew kisses. The pro-demo cracy media tycoon was testifying in his national-security trial, which began in December 2023. Already the 77-year-old has been locked behind bars for more than four years, mostly in solitary confinement. This was a show of defiance from a man who has spent his life defending freedom&#8212;and will probably die doing so.</p><p>&#8220;The Troublemaker&#8221; recounts the vertiginous rise and fall of Hong Kong&#8217;s most famous tycoon-turned-political prisoner. For decades Mr Lai symbolised the island&#8217;s promise, having arrived as a 12-year-old refugee from China. As the city&#8217;s economy boomed, he worked his way up from the floor of a garment factory to establish a retail empire. An outspoken critic of communism, he wrote a column in 1994 calling Li Peng, then China&#8217;s prime minister, &#8220;a turtle egg&#8221; (which is far more insulting in Man darin than it sounds in English).</p><p>Facing pressure from Chinese authorities, he sold his stake in his clothing company for $185m in 1996 ($345m in today&#8217;s money). He used the proceeds to fund his pro-democracy media business, Next Digital, with titles such as <i>Next Magazine</i> and <i>Apple Daily</i> (a nod to the forbidden fruit). Both peddled a curious mix of free thinking and sex. <i>Apple Daily</i> featured restaurant-style reviews of Hong Kong&#8217;s prostitutes; the author was &#8220;Fei Long&#8221; (Fat Dragon), a popular nickname for the treasury secretary. When the feature was paused temporarily, circulation dropped by 30%.</p><p>After people took to the streets for pro-democracy protests in 2003, 2014 and 2019, Mr Lai&#8217;s papers championed the demonstrations. He protested, too, always peacefully, and held meetings with foreign officials to enlist their support, including Mike Pence, America&#8217;s vice-president under Donald Trump from 2017-21.</p><p>After the government in Beijing imposed a draconian national-security law on Hong Kong in June 2020, Mr Lai knew he would be one of its first targets. The follow ing month 250 police raided and frogmarched him through <i>Apple Daily</i>&#8217;s offices in handcuffs. The paper responded by splashing a photograph of Mr Lai across its front pages with the headline &#8220; <i>Apple</i> will definitely keep fighting.&#8221; He was released on bail but soon detained again. <i>Apple Daily</i> was closed the next year.</p><p>Mark Clifford, the book&#8217;s author, has written a compelling biography and shows an eye for detail. He depicts a bullish and generous man who was as uncompromising in business as in politics. Mr Clifford is a former board director at Next Digital and a friend of Mr Lai&#8217;s, which has given him privileged access to his subject&#8217;s personal life and professional endeavours. (His name was also mentioned at the trial.)</p><p>Such closeness is both the book&#8217;s strength and its weakness. At points &#8220;The Troublemaker&#8221; verges on hagiography. Unfavourable incidents are skated over, such as how Mr Lai could be very harsh and tough on his employees, prompting some to call their boss &#8220;Chairman Mao who speaks English&#8221; behind his back. But if this frustrates a nuanced understanding of the man, it frees up the narrative to focus on the collapse of civil liberties in Hong Kong.</p><p>The most moving passages reflect on Mr Lai&#8217;s decision to stay. As a billionaire with British citizenship, he had every opportunity to flee. &#8220;I must face the consequences of my actions, just or unjust,&#8221; he wrote from prison. &#8220;It is also a way to uphold the dignity of Hong Kong people, as one of the leaders for the fight of freedom.&#8221;</p><p>Mr Lai faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for supposed collusion with foreign forces and a separate charge of sedition. His supporters argue his only crime is pro-democracy journalism. Mr Lai is likely to be found guilty: national-security trials have a 97% conviction rate. He is sustained by his faith and love for his wife. Like Alexei Navalny, a dissident who returned to Russia despite obvious peril, Mr Lai sacrificed his liberty for his beliefs.</p><p class="end has-stop">&#8220;The Troublemaker&#8221; has little hope of changing Mr Lai&#8217;s fate. But it does aim to keep public attention on the trial, despite its agonisingly slow pace. (Critics of the national-security law claim delays are a way to punish defendants before conviction and curtail media attention.) &#8220;Authorities want to erase him,&#8221; Mr Clifford writes. His book sets down the story of his colleague&#8217;s life using ink and paper, Mr Lai&#8217;s own weapons of choice. </p>
