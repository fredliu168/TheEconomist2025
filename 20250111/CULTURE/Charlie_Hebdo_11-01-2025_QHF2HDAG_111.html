        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">O</span><small>N THE MORNING</small> of January 7th 2015 two men, Chérif and Saïd Kouachi, stormed the offices of <i>Charlie Hebdo</i>, a French satirical newspaper. Armed with Kalashnikovs, the pair murdered 12 people, including eight editorial staff, in less than two minutes. The perpetrators, who were linked to al-Qaeda, did not pick <i>Charlie Hebdo</i> by chance. For years the irreverent newspaper had poked fun at religion, including Islam. It was the start of the worst-ever year of Islamist terrorist attacks in Paris, which killed nearly 150 people.</p><p>A decade on, <i>Charlie Hebdo</i> is unbowed and unrepentant, turning out a weekly as tasteless, silly and provocative as ever. But the paper now operates from a secure and undisclosed location. Laurent Sourisseau, a cartoonist known as Riss, survived the massacre and took over the editorship after the attack. Radical Islamists have called for his death, and he lives under police protection. <i>The Economist</i> met him at an unmarked third-party office.</p><p>Nothing has since been quite the same for <i>Charlie Hebdo</i>. Yet the paper has nurtured a new generation of cartoonists and published every week since that awful winter morning. Its circulation today is some 50,000&#8212;over 25% higher than before the attack. &#8220;We think about it all the time, but we don&#8217;t talk about it all the time,&#8221; says Riss. &#8220;You can&#8217;t be crushed by this history.&#8221;</p><p>To mark the anniversary, <i>Charlie Hebdo</i> has published a book entitled &#8220;Charlie Liberty&#8221;. It is a way for survivors to pay tribute to former colleagues, five of them cartoonists: Cabu, Charb, Honoré, Tignous and Wolinski. <i>Charlie Hebdo</i> has continued a French tradition of political caricature, often scurrilous and obscene, which has deep roots. Bawdy, anti-royalist cartoons ridiculed Marie-Antoinette and Louis XVI in the 18th century. Over 1,500 satirical engravings were produced in the decade following the revolution in 1789.</p><p>The merit of drawings, says Riss, is that they are a &#8220;simple visual language, understood by everyone, to speak about difficult things&#8221;. Founded in 1970, <i>Charlie Hebdo</i> spares nothing and no one. Its caricatures range from the irreligious (the Prophet Muhammad displaying his pimply bottom) to the political (Marine Le Pen shaving her pubic hair). The paper regularly irks the regimes in Iran and Turkey, either for mocking their leaders or for joking about Islam.</p><p><i>Charlie Hebdo</i>&#8217;s detractors, though, are not only religious rulers. Shortly after the attack in 2015, a handful of American writers boycotted a gala dinner in New York at which the French paper was getting an award for courage, on the ground that its caricatures humiliate Muslims.</p><p>In secular France, the law forbids hate speech or incitement to violence but protects blasphemy. Yet <i>Charlie Hebdo</i> is still controversial in its home country. <i>Mediapart</i>, a left-wing newspaper, recently denounced a caricature of the conflict between secular France and hard-line Islamism, which <i>Charlie Hebdo</i> represented as a woman wearing a burqa and a bearded man. It was, said <i>Mediapart</i>, a &#8220;sinister&#8221; form of Islamophobia lifted straight from the far-right playbook. (<i>Charlie Hebdo</i> dismisses such charges as absurd.)</p><p>Today French support for the defiant <i>Charlie Hebdo</i> spirit&#8212;known as &#8220;Je suis Charlie&#8221;&#8212;seems more fragile. It was strong in 2020 after Samuel Paty, a school teacher, was decapitated by a terrorist. (He had shown pupils caricatures of Muhammad in a class about free speech.) Yet by 2023 only 58% of the French told a poll &#8220;Je suis Charlie&#8221;, down from 71% in 2016.</p><p>This may reflect a general trend in the West of growing intolerance for causing offence. American stand-up comics including Dave Chappelle have criticised censorious attitudes towards satire. &#8220;We can&#8217;t say anything anymore!&#8221; laments a character in a cartoon in the latest issue of <i>Nouvel Obs</i>, a French magazine; &#8220;You can&#8217;t say that!&#8221; replies his companion. In 2019, after a caricature of Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel&#8217;s prime minister, prompted an outcry, the <i>New York Times</i> stopped publishing political cartoons. On January 3rd a cartoonist resigned from the <i>Washington Post</i> after the paper rejected her depiction of its owner, Jeff Bezos, and other bosses kneeling before a statue of Donald Trump.</p><p class="end has-stop">Self-censorship, rather than the law, now tempers satire. Plantu, a cartoonist at <i>Le Monde</i>, has argued that <i>dessinateurs</i> &#8220;no longer [have] the same freedom&#8221;. Riss suggests that <i>Charlie Hebdo</i> is &#8220;not extraordinarily provocative&#8221;, but seems so because &#8220;the margin of tolerance&#8221; is narrowing. Ten years on, the paper&#8217;s voice is gross but precious. &#8220;We&#8217;re doing exactly the same thing we did before,&#8221; Riss insists. &#8220;But around us people are much more timid.&#8221; </p>
