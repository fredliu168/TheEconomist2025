          <p><span data-caps="initial">&#8220;S</span><small>O WE MUST</small> break up?&#8221; he asked her. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said. His face darkened, and he jammed on the brakes. The car screeched to a halt. Without warning, he flung the door open. &#8220;Then get out!&#8221; he cried. They were on a narrow mountain road, with desolate wilderness all around. Did he really mean to abandon her? But as soon as she left he slammed the door, revved up the engine and aimed for the cliff-edge. Instinctively, she hurled herself onto the bonnet to save him. At the very edge, he stopped and got out. As she almost slid off, into the abyss, he pulled her into his arms.</p><p>To cut a long story short, she married him, and they were together for 40 years. But this was not one of Chiung Yao&#8217;s 65 novels; it was a scene from her own life. She was the passionate heroine, torn between obeying her lover and living freely. He was Ping Hsin-tao, head of the Crown publishing company. In 1963 he had published her first novel, &#8220;Outside the Window&#8221;, a huge success all over the Chinese-speaking world. After that, remorselessly, he ordered her to write more, even two at once. When she told him she couldn&#8217;t, he shouted that she could, and she succeeded. She and Hsin-tao adapted most of them for film and television, and in 1998 her adaptation of &#8220;My Fair Princess&#8221;, an imaginary saga of the Qing dynasty, became the most-viewed <small>TV</small> series in China.</p><p>At the height of her success in the 1970s and 80s it seemed that everyone, female at least, was reading her books. (&#8221;That&#8217;s so Chiung Yao!&#8221; people would say of anything romantic.) They offered stories of love that triumphed despite differences of wealth or class, parental disapproval, etiquette or stifling tradition. There were many, many ups and downs, much pain, many tears (she loved to cry herself, the sign of a softening heart). Both her book titles and the names of her heroines, which became popular too, suggested something beautiful but fragile: &#8220;Dream&#8221;, &#8220;Cloud&#8221;, &#8220;Rain&#8221;. Yet despite their apparent weakness or submissiveness, these were women who insisted on loving as they chose.</p><p>As did she. She took &#8220;Chiung Yao&#8221;, &#8220;beautiful jade&#8221;, as her pen-name, pretty but adamant. And from early childhood she was already in love, with words. Her mother taught Chinese literature in primary school, to which girls in conservative Sichuan were not allowed to go. But she would sit by the door, listening. When she was six she startled her mother by correctly reading the characters for &#8220;night&#8221; in a wistful poem of the Tang era. Both the melancholy, and Tang poetry, stayed with her. From that point, she read and read. At school in Taiwan, to which the family fled in 1949 from the Sino-Japanese war, she realised that all she wanted to do was write. Rather than retake the college entrance exam, which she had twice failed, she bought manuscript paper, ink and pens and began her life in earnest. This was not a career, her parents told her. But then, to her, neither was marriage.</p><p>Instead, at 18, she fell for the literature teacher at her high school. He was 25 years older, widowed and lonely, but, as in &#8220;My Fair Princess&#8221;, they could watch &#8220;the snow, the stars and the moon&#8221; together, and talk poetry. So the affair began, and went on even when the school learned of it and dismissed him for seducing a minor. When she realised she would have to give him up, she was devastated. Even the success of &#8220;Outside the Window&#8221;, her account of it all, could not dull the pain of losing him.</p><p>Yet she fell for a writer again. His clothes were worn almost to romantic rags, and his shack had just a bed, a table and chair, a pen and paper; but that, he said, was all a writer needed. She loved him for that. It was a disaster. He was jealous of her ever-growing success, especially as his attempt to write the Great Chinese Novel was not going well. He called her works shallow and sentimental; she was just &#8220;telling stories&#8221;. In one of their epic rows, she shot back that yes, she was telling stories. She loved telling stories! He should leave her alone to go on writing her shallow lowbrow stuff!</p><p>It was true that, as a writer, she was not a great wife. She could sew, but her kitchen skills ran mostly to rice and fried eggs. She controlled the family budget, but was saving for things, like a refrigerator, whose hidden purpose was to save her shopping and extend her writing time. They had a little son, Xiaoqing, whom she adored, but she wrote in every spare moment when the baby was not crying, or wrote with him in her arms, and sent him to nursery as soon as she could. That marriage could not last; this was not how wives and mothers were supposed to behave.</p><p>Nor was a woman supposed to fall for a married man, as she did afterwards. She tried not to, but Hsin-tao insisted, and his insistence had proved right before. So after eight years of wrangling over his divorce they got married. They were discreet; it was billed as a lunch party. They became, officially, a power couple on the literary scene, and she became a model of rebellious, dramatic or improper love, whichever way people saw it.</p><p>By far the most dramatic episodes, however, had happened long before, as she and her family struggled across China in the war. Disguised as peasants, they lodged in farmhouse after farmhouse that was torched by the advancing Japanese. When they fled, they narrowly escaped being shot as they hid in woodsheds and ravines. Her brothers went missing, presumed dead; at which point her parents rolled into the Dong&#8217;an river to drown themselves. She followed, terrified, and her cries revived their love for her. Having seen death up close, she realised both the fragility of life and the endurance of love. That was her real education.</p><p class="end has-stop">Life, she learned, was a spark that should blaze, not miserably fade. Twice, in the throes of love, she had taken overdoses. She had watched Hsin-tao, felled by a stroke, linger for three years. As she aged, she vowed to control her own death. Once she had been fiery enough to fling herself on her lover&#8217;s moving car. Now, in a poem she left before turning on the gas, she was a snowflake flying lightly away to dance with the sparks of the stars. </p>
