        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">B</span><small>RITONS ARE</small> back in the office&#8212;and not just because a new year has begun. Five years after the start of the pandemic, ever more employers are demanding that their staff come in three, four or even five days a week, forcing many to abandon home offices eagerly acquired, furnished and decorated during lockdown. That turn in the trend is showing in Britain&#8217;s housing market. Properties, often large ones outside London, bought and built in the hope that covid had consigned commuting to the past, no longer look so desirable.</p><p>The switch back from working at home has gathered pace. According to the Virgin Media <small>O</small>2 Business Movers Index, which tracks commuting behaviour in Britain, the number of companies requiring employees to turn up three or more days a week rose to 75% in 2024, from 67% the year before. Bosses at half the firms it surveys have ordered staff back for at least four days, up from 46%. Nearly one in three companies insist that employees are in the office for a full five days.</p><p>On January 7th <small>WPP</small>, an advertising giant, became the latest to tighten its policy. From April it will require its workers to be in the office four days a week. Nearly two-fifths of British workers now commute five days a week; 83% of business leaders polled by <small>KPMG</small>, an auditor, say they expect a full return to the office by 2027.</p><p>All this is undermining the home-buying habits formed during lockdown. So far, house prices overall have remained resilient, even though interest rates are no longer at rock-bottom. They rose by 3.3% in 2024, according to Halifax, a big mortgage lender. But cracks are appearing in the prices of homes that were sought after for their large gardens or extra rooms when covid was at its height.</p><p>In 2024 detached properties, the prices of which rocketed during the pandemic, recorded the weakest price growth of any category for the second year running&#8212;behind flats, semi-detached and terraced houses, according to Nationwide, another leading lender. They are also proving harder to sell. Detached houses take 73 days to find a buyer, twice as long as they did in 2022 and longer than other homes, says Rightmove, a property website.</p><p>Even at the top end of the market, prices are adjusting to this new reality. Outside London, prices of &#8220;prime&#8221; properties, valued at Â£1m ($1.2m) or more, have fallen by nearly 7% from their peak in September 2022, says Lucian Cook, head of residential research at Savills, an estate agent.</p><p>Higher mortgage costs explain some of this. But dwindling demand in areas that Londoners flocked to during lockdowns, sending prime-property prices up by 17% between 2020 and 2023, suggests a structural shift. Prime-property prices in coastal regions, which performed strongly during the pandemic, declined by more than 5% last year, for instance. It marks the end of both the race for space and the dash to the countryside, says Mr Cook.</p><p>Markets closer to London appear to be heading the other way&#8212;perhaps reflecting a renewed need to be within commuting distance. The capital&#8217;s prime markets, which lagged behind those in the rest of the country during covid, are returning to modest growth: prices rose by 1.4% in 2024, according to Savills.</p><p>As preferences and prices change, so do developers&#8217; priorities. Many housebuilders shifted away from flats towards detached homes after the global financial crisis to appeal to cash-rich buyers (see chart). In 2008 detached properties made up 15% of new housing stock, according to the National House Building Council.</p><figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250111_BRC311.png"></div></figure><p>A government-backed help-to-buy scheme, initiated by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition in 2013, helped first-time buyers purchase larger homes by lending them part of a property&#8217;s value. By 2019 detached houses&#8217; share had reached nearly 30%. The pandemic reinforced the trend. By 2022 the desire for more space had boosted the share of detached homes in new housing to more than 35%.</p><p class="end has-stop">Developers are adjusting their inventory once again. Last year the number of new detached homes was down by more than half from its peak in 2022&#8212;a larger decline than for flats, terraced houses or semi-detached homes. The return to the office and the end of cheap debt are pointing the same way: no longer able to afford the houses they want, Britons are settling for the ones they need. </p>
