        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">I</span><small>N 1996 TOMMY SUHARTO</small>, the youngest son of Indonesia&#8217;s dictator, set out to build the Timor, a national car. The plan was to import models manufactured by Kia Motors, a South Korean carmaker, and rebrand them. Kia would teach Indonesians carmaking; strict local-content requirements would ensure the economy benefited. But as a financial crisis in 1997 battered Indonesia&#8217;s car market, 15,000 Timors sat idle in a car park. By 1998, as riots in Java brought down the Suharto regime, embarrassed Indonesians who owned the national car tore off their &#8220; <small>T</small>&#8221; logos. Under pressure from furious trade partners, the Timor was withdrawn.</p><p>Yet the economic-nationalist spirit that infused the Timor has never quite gone away. Today, it animates Indonesia&#8217;s programme of &#8220;downstreaming&#8221;, or moving towards higher value-added activity. The policy is being championed afresh by Prabowo Subianto, the new president.</p><p>One mineral is the linchpin of this policy: nickel, a crucial material for electric vehicle (<small>EV</small>) batteries. A nickel-ore export ban came into force in 2020. Now, Indonesia dominates global nickel-mining and smelting. It produces nearly half the world&#8217;s refined nickel and two-thirds of its mined nickel. Both shares have doubled since 2020. In 2023 Indonesian exports of processed nickel amounted to $22bn, or 9% of total exports, up from 2% in 2019.</p><p>As Indonesia&#8217;s market share has multiplied, so too has the grandeur of its politicians&#8217; ambitions. With local content requirements as a stick and lavish tax incentives as a carrot, the idea is to create a complete <small>EV</small> supply chain on Indonesian soil. So far, only China has managed to do this. Even so, politicians are bullish. Luhut Pandjaitan, the architect of downstreaming, thinks Indonesia could be a top-three producer of both batteries and <small>EV</small>s by 2027.</p><p>Such estimates are not mere hyperbole. The country has reserves of nearly all the necessary raw materials to build <small>EV</small>s, from copper to cobalt. Moreover, virtually no one foresaw Indonesia&#8217;s abrupt takeover of the nickel market, powered by new smelting technology and investment from Chinese mining firms. At a conference in Jakarta, the capital, on November 26th, the mood was defiant. &#8220;For us, this is a matter of survival,&#8221; Mr Luhut told investors.</p><h3>Electric dreams</h3><p>What are downstreaming&#8217;s aims? First is Mr Prabowo&#8217;s ambitious target for Indonesia&#8217;s <small>GDP</small> to grow by 8% each year, which officials hope to achieve by supercharging export-oriented foreign direct investment (<small>FDI</small>). (The average growth rate has been around 5% over the past two decades.) Another goal is to boost growth beyond Java.</p><p>An additional motive is that Indonesia&#8217;s policy wonks, haunted by the rupiah&#8217;s plunge during the Asian financial crisis of 1997, want to bolster the currency by exporting more. They also want to reverse premature deindustrialisation. Since 2002 Indonesia&#8217;s manufacturing value-added share of <small>GDP</small> has nearly halved. Finally, as part of Mr Prabowo&#8217;s drive for energy security, he wants to foster a domestic <small>EV</small> market. Once a member of <small>OPEC</small>, an oil cartel, Indonesia became a net oil importer in 2004 after a decade of declining production. (It is still declining.)</p><p>So far, downstreaming has had some successes. Since the nickel-ore export ban, <small>FDI</small> has surged, largely into industrial sites away from Java (see map). In Central Sulawesi, home to a nickel-smelting complex, exports have risen from $5.9bn in 2019 to around $21bn in 2024. The province, just a third as rich as Java in per-person terms, has become Indonesia&#8217;s second-most favoured <small>FDI</small> destination. In the poorer province of South-East Sulawesi, which hosts several smelting operations, manufacturing has grown at twice the rate of regional <small>GDP</small> in recent years. (<small>FDI</small> boomed in 2020-21 but has since slowed.) Nickel exports helped Indonesia&#8217;s trade surplus reach a record high in 2022.</p><figure class="media media--map media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250111_ASM939.png"></div></figure><p>But efforts to boost reindustrialisation have been less impressive. Indonesia&#8217;s realised foothold in the <small>EV</small> supply chain is tiny. It is on track to produce 10 <small>GW</small>h of battery capacity this year, with another 25-45 <small>GW</small>h in the pipeline through 2027, reckons Putra Adhiguna of the Energy Shift Institute, a think-tank. By contrast global capacity was 2,600 <small>GW</small>h in 2023. Indonesia hosts just two of the world&#8217;s over 400 planned or operational battery giga-factories, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a research service. This pattern holds for &#8220;midstream&#8221; investments in battery ingredients, too. Indonesia&#8217;s <small>FDI</small> boom has created &#8220;shallow industrialisation&#8221;, says Mr Adhiguna. Vast sums are flowing into building one stage of the <small>EV</small> supply chain (nickel processing), with a small sprinkling of investment everywhere else.</p><h3>Danger! High voltage</h3><p>Officials counter that deployment takes time. &#8220;If you build upstream [ie, minerals processing] and downstream first, midstream investments will come,&#8221; says Septian Hario Seto, Indonesia&#8217;s deputy minister of investment co-ordination. In the meantime, hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs are being created in nickel smelting.</p><p>However, even this job creation is less impressive than it seems. Patchy data makes the aggregate effect hard to measure. But smelting is a capital-intensive investment. The <small>FDI</small> surge has created temporary construction jobs that will last only as long as the industrial sites are expanding. A typical smelting plant initially employing 30,000 people only generates a few thousand long-term jobs, says a mining bigwig in Jakarta.</p><p>Regions that have experienced runaway export growth are not seeing accompanying reductions in unemployment or poverty. In Konawe, a rural area of 250,000 in South-East Sulawesi that hosts an industrial park owned by Tsingshan, a Chinese steel and nickel company, unemployment is above pre-export ban levels, find Hilman Palaon and Robert Walker of the Lowy Institute, an Australian think-tank. Workers&#8217; associations report that mid-skill roles are being filled by workers brought in from Java, while locals fill lower-level jobs such as janitors, says Mr Palaon, who visited the area earlier last year.</p><p>Indonesia is also failing to cultivate a demand base for electric cars. It has rolled out a bewildering array of tax nudges to lower the cost of electric two- and four-wheelers. A recent paper by Siwage Dharma Negara, an Indonesia expert, counts 12 distinct incentives or exemptions. A charging-station network is being built; over 1,500 are in operation. Even so, a low-cost gas guzzler remains 40% cheaper than the equivalent <small>EV</small>. As a result, just 12,000 electric cars were sold last year, compared with overall car sales of 1m.</p><p>Even among the <small>EV</small>s that have been sold, the vast majority use non-nickel batteries. Nickel&#8217;s energy density gives batteries superior range, but it is more expensive and less durable than the main alternative, lithium-iron-phosphate (<small>LFP</small>) batteries. Indonesia is better suited to cheap, lightweight electric vehicles powered by the <small>LFP</small> type. Moreover, the global <small>EV</small> battery market is already oversupplied. The amount of batteries made last year in China alone could fully satisfy global demand, according to Bloomberg <small>NEF</small>, a research service. And other countries in South-East Asia are competing hard for investment, such as Thailand and Vietnam.</p><p>Finally, there are negative consequences of downstreaming. Much nickel ore is situated under rainforests; extracting it has led to huge deforestation. Smelting is a dirty business. A drumbeat of harrowing industrial accidents has sullied the industry&#8217;s reputation. America has put Indonesian nickel on its &#8220;forced labour&#8221; list. Fishermen in islands off North Maluku complain that heavy metal pollution is poisoning their catch. The government has begun a clean-up effort. In October, North Maluku-based Harita Nickel said it would undergo an audit by <small>IRMA</small>, a Western mining-standards body. But the chief environmental concern remains untackled: lethal air pollution from burning coal (which powers two-thirds of Indonesia&#8217;s electricity generation). The nickel-smelting boom has led to even more burning; many of the new industrial parks have dedicated coal plants on-site.</p><p class="end has-stop">Indonesia will probably develop some sort of <small>EV</small> supply chain thanks to downstreaming. But what is missing is a judicious weighing of costs and benefits. The risk is that Indonesia is spending vast state resources to grab a tiny share of an oversaturated industry, creating a modest number of factory jobs at a serious cost to the environment. Tommy Suharto&#8217;s efforts were not totally in vain; tens of thousands of Timor cars were sold. But, in the end, Indonesians were no richer for it. </p>
