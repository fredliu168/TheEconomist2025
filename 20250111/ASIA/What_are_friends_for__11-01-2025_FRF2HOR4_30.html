        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">W</span><small>ITHIN 24 HOURS</small> on January 6th, two events took place that encapsulate the mixed legacy Joe Biden will leave in America&#8217;s relationship with Japan. That afternoon North Korea tested an intermediate-range ballistic missile, and America shared data about the launch in real time with Japan and South Korea; such co-operation is the fruit of the Biden administration&#8217;s efforts to foster closer ties between allies in the Indo-Pacific. Later that day, Nippon Steel, a Japanese steel firm, sued the American government over Mr Biden&#8217;s recent decision to scupper its acquisition of <small>US</small> Steel, an American one.</p><p>Under Mr Biden, security co-operation with Japan has flourished. America and Japan have ramped up joint exercises, deepened intelligence sharing and better integrated their armed forces; the two have also worked in closer concert with other American allies in the region. This has all unfolded with the clear aim of deterring China. Rahm Emanuel, America&#8217;s outgoing ambassador to Japan, argues that the alliance is &#8220;better prepared&#8221; to do so than it was four years ago.</p><p>That was hardly a given. Japanese officials met Mr Biden&#8217;s victory in 2020 with some apprehension. Ahead of the election that year, one senior Japanese foreign ministry official even wrote an anonymous article praising Donald Trump&#8217;s confrontational strategy towards China and lamenting a possible return to engagement with China under a Democratic administration. Those fears proved unfounded. Mr Biden accelerated America&#8217;s hard turn on China and made alliances central to his approach. &#8220;The Indo-Pacific is a home game for China; it&#8217;s an away game for the United States,&#8221; Mr Emanuel says. Allies like Japan help to &#8220;level the playing field for us&#8221;.</p><p>Tighter security ties became possible because of changes in Japan, which moved to accelerate its defence build-up in the wake of Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine. There was a realisation that &#8220;things have to be moved into the second and third gear by the Japanese for the Japanese,&#8221; says Mr Emanuel. That spurred America to undertake long-discussed reforms of its own, such as restructuring its command-and-control systems in the region. Japan pushed America to &#8220;rip the band-aid off and do something that we all knew had to get done,&#8221; he reckons. The armed forces of the two allies have never been closer.</p><p>Yet Mr Biden will leave office on a sour note with Japan. One of his last acts as president was killing the Nippon Steel deal, on the grounds that such investment from a Japanese firm poses a national security threat to America (see Business section). Japanese reactions have been unusually sharp. Ishiba Shigeru, the prime minister, demanded that America &#8220;clearly explain why there are security concerns&#8221;. Japanese business leaders expressed surprise and dismay; many say it may impact future investment decisions. &#8220;This is a one-off case, but it will still carry major ramifications,&#8221; argues William Chou of the Hudson Institute, an American think-tank.</p><p class="end has-stop">Japan and America have weathered frequent bouts of economic friction in their decades-long alliance. No single commercial transaction is big enough to throw the whole relationship off-course. But the affair is indicative of America&#8217;s broader protectionist turn. Japan&#8217;s biggest gripe about Mr Biden&#8217;s approach to the Indo-Pacific has long been the absence of a trade policy. One response for Japan may be to seek closer economic ties with China; plans to host a state visit for Xi Jinping, China&#8217;s leader, are reportedly in the works. Mr Emanuel, for his part, calls for America to develop a &#8220;more nuanced position&#8221; on trade, between &#8220;ignoring, as we did over 30 years, all the downsides of trade&#8221; and &#8220;the position that all trade is bad regardless of the benefit&#8221;. Nuance, alas, is unlikely to be a hallmark of Mr Biden&#8217;s successor. </p>
