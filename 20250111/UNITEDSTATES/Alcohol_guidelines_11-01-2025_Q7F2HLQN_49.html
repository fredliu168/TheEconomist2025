        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">T</span><small>HIS TIME</small> of the year is when people make resolutions they may struggle to keep. One reason for that is confusion. According to Gallup, a pollster, three in five adults drink alcohol. About 45% think drinking even in moderation is bad for their health, while 43% think it has no effect. Americans drink more spirits (or hard liquor) now than during the Civil War&#8212;a time period so filled with drunkenness that some historians say it sparked the temperance movement. This is despite something that has long been known by public-health researchers.</p><p>The nerds got their way on January 3rd, when Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, America&#8217;s top doctor, issued an advisory on the link between drinking alcohol and cancer. He wants the labels on alcoholic drinks to carry a cancer warning. Alcohol, the advisory notes, is the third leading preventable cause of cancer in America, after tobacco and obesity. It accounts for nearly 100,000 cancer cases a year. But while 89% of Americans know that tobacco can cause cancer, less than half are aware that alcohol does too.</p><figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250111_USC347.png"></div></figure><p>That is partly because the risk from alcohol is smaller, but it is not trivial. According to the surgeon-general&#8217;s report, 17% of women who drink occasionally will be diagnosed, at some point in life, with one of the seven cancers for which alcohol&#8217;s causal effect has been established. For women who have two drinks a day the cancer rate goes up to 22%. Among men, the cancer rate goes up from 10% among occasional drinkers to 13% among those having two drinks a day.</p><p>The link between alcohol and cancer is not scientific news. The World Health Organisation classified alcohol as a carcinogen in 1988. Yet nearly 10% of Americans today say that drinking is good for health. Some of the confusion stems from studies that have found, over the years, that moderate drinkers live longer than non-drinkers. This result is explained mostly by a seemingly protective effect of moderate drinking against heart disease.</p><p>But what scientists have learned over the years is that plain comparisons of drinkers and non-drinkers make alcohol seem healthier than it may be. Many abstainers have given up alcohol because they are too unwell; some are former alcoholics. How researchers account for these &#8220;sick quitters&#8221; matters. Some exclude all non-drinkers from the analyses and only measure how risks of disease change with the amount of drinking; others group ex-drinkers with current drinkers. With such adjustments, the protective effect of moderate drinking on longevity and heart disease nearly disappears; the increased cancer risk chalked up to drinking goes up.</p><p>Newer studies that use genetic tolerance to alcohol to mimic randomised trials of drinking have found no health benefits from alcohol. This study method mitigates biases: people who drink are richer, more educated and healthier than those who do not. That may explain why red wine, rich people&#8217;s drink of choice, has seemed particularly heart-healthy. Most scientists now see the idea of alcohol being beneficial in moderation as &#8220;either exaggerated or completely false&#8221;, says Tim Stockwell from the University of Victoria in Canada.</p><p class="end has-stop">Americans are bombarded with headlines about the benefits of alcohol (&#8220;Wine may be good for the heart, new study says&#8221;). Occasionally, a headline gives them pause (&#8220;Even a little alcohol can harm your health&#8221;). The surgeon-general&#8217;s message may clear the air&#8212;and make resolutions to drink less stick better. </p>
