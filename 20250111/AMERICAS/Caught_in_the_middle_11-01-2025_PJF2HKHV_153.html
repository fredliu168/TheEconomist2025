          <figure class="media media--drawing media--wide"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250111_AMD001.png"></div></figure><p><span data-caps="initial">I</span><small>N 2018</small> the United States&#8217; president, Donald Trump, started a trade war with China. Mexico benefited. Companies seeking to avoid tariffs by diversifying production away from China looked to Mexico for its affordable labour, decent infrastructure and, most importantly, its free-trade accord with the United States.</p><p>As Mr Trump&#8217;s second term approaches, that logic is souring. Chinese companies were keener on Mexico more than most. Their investment in the country has surged. Mr Trump (who has already threatened to apply a tariff of 25% to Mexican imports &#8220;on day one&#8221; unless it stops migrants and drugs from illegally crossing the border) believes those firms are using Mexico as a tariff-free gateway to the United States. His conviction may end up blowing apart the United States-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement (<small>USMCA</small>).</p><p>Chinese firms making products in Mexico for sale in the United States are the focus of concern. In 2023 Mexico overtook China to become the leading exporter of goods to the United States; meanwhile, Chinese exports to Mexico have boomed (see chart 1). In 2002 less than 5% by value of the components in Mexican exports to the United States were Chinese; by 2020 that was 21%.</p><figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250111_EPC293.png"></div></figure><p>Electric-vehicle production is the big issue. Most of the <small>EV</small>s sold worldwide are Chinese-made, usually at a lower price than those made by American firms, and of equivalent or higher quality. In September President Joe Biden raised tariffs on imports of <small>EV</small>s from China to 100%; without them, sales would boom. But those tariffs do not apply to vehicles made in Mexico.</p><p>Mr Trump claims that Chinese carmakers are constructing &#8220;monster&#8221; factories south of the border. That is false. Just one Chinese joint venture makes <small>EV</small>s for the Mexican and regional market. <small>BYD</small>, China&#8217;s leading <small>EV</small> manufacturer, has said it will build a factory in Mexico to churn out 150,000 vehicles a year, but it has yet to materialise. Last year Solarever, a smaller producer, announced it would build a factory in northern Mexico.</p><p>The areas where Chinese firms really are expanding tend to be further down the supply chain. Eight Chinese auto-parts manufacturing companies operated in Mexico in 2018. By the end of 2023 there were at least 20. They make trims and battery casings as well as high-tech elements such as software to assist drivers. Many cars made in Mexico with Chinese components meet the <small>USMCA</small> requirement that 75% of a car must be made in Mexico, whether by Chinese companies or otherwise, to qualify for free trade. But it doesn&#8217;t matter if it is legal, says Joshua Meltzer of Brookings, a think-tank in Washington: &#8220;Political tolerance [for China] is going down.&#8221; Anything with a whiff of China is seen as suspicious. &#8220;Made by China is the new Made in China,&#8221; says Jorge Guajardo, a former Mexican ambassador to China.</p><h3>Depends who you ask</h3><p>Mexican officials complain that the focus on their country is hypocritical: Chinese foreign direct investment (<small>FDI</small>) into Mexico is small compared with the billions China invests in the United States every year. But Chinese <small>FDI</small> there has been growing sharply, while its <small>FDI</small> into the United States has fallen. It does not help that Mexico&#8217;s official <small>FDI</small> figures seem to undercount Chinese investment by a factor of six (see chart 2), according to the Rhodium Group, a research firm, which finds that $13bn has been invested cumulatively since 2013. Mexico is paying the price for &#8220;being slow to read the writing on the wall,&#8221; says one North American diplomat.</p><figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250111_EPC294.png"></div></figure><p>Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico&#8217;s president, has read it. Her government is scrambling to please its northern neighbour, setting up a body to screen foreign investments that apes those in the United States and Canada. It has plans to substitute imported Chinese components with ones made in Mexico. Marcelo Ebrard, the economy secretary, says Mexico must start making microchips and lithium batteries. Other Trump-pleasing measures are coming thick and fast. &#8220;Mexico wants to be a team with Canada and the United States,&#8221; says Luis Rosendo Gutiérrez, an official with Mexico&#8217;s economy ministry.</p><p>Yet the discussion is detached from the reality of the complex nature of trade, says Enrique Dussel Peters, who runs the Centre for Chinese-Mexican Studies at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Foreign companies in Mexico, predominantly American ones, account for 70% of the exports to the United States. American carmakers like General Motors and Ford are among those that have integrated Chinese companies into their supply chains.</p><p>Rejigging supply chains takes time and requires incentives. Mexico&#8217;s cash-strapped government cannot afford subsidies for domestic production of chips and batteries like those in the United States. Some items simply can&#8217;t be sourced outside China. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t developed supply chains in the region for items like batteries for <small>EV</small>s,&#8221; says Odracir Barquera of the Mexican Automotive Industry Association.</p><p class="end has-stop">Mexico has another worry. In the 2000s it lost out to China in exports to the United States. If Chinese companies start displacing Mexican ones in North American supply chains, Mexico will suffer again, notes Margaret Myers of the Inter-American Dialogue, a think-tank in Washington. Here American and Mexican officials see eye-to-eye. &#8220;The message to the United States is &#8216;How do I help you make what you import from Asia?&#8217;&#8221; says Mr Gutiérrez. &#8220;Because it will help us, too.&#8221; </p>
