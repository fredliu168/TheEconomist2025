        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">I</span><small>N 2017 CLAUDIO</small> Silva, who a few years earlier returned to Angola after growing up in America, was optimistic that the country of his birth was turning a corner. That year João Lourenço became president, replacing José Eduardo dos Santos, the corrupt autocrat who ran sub-Saharan Africa&#8217;s second-largest oil producer for 38 years. The new president pledged to reform the economy and to cut graft.</p><p>Today Mr Silva is sceptical. His dream of setting up a restaurant showcasing local produce has been delayed by venal officials demanding bribes. &#8220;I realise the more you try not to be corrupt the more you get punished,&#8221; he says.</p><p>Mr Lourenço&#8217;s team insists the president is overhauling Angola. &#8220;You don&#8217;t change a political system overnight,&#8221; warns a cabinet minister. But business people all have stories of graft. Beyond Luanda, the capital, there is little sign of the tens of billions of dollars earned from oil. Most of the population lives in poverty. Public spending on health and education is around 3% of <small>GDP</small>, less than half the regional average. &#8220;We had the potential to accumulate generational wealth,&#8221; Mr Silva sighs, &#8220;just as the population was exploding. But we didn&#8217;t leave enough on the table.&#8221;</p><figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250111_SRC172.png"></div></figure><p>There is frustration with politics all across Africa. A decade ago the share of Africans telling Afrobarometer, a pollster, that their country was going in the wrong direction was roughly the same as the share who felt it was on the right track. These days twice as many Africans think things are going badly (see chart). Young people have recently taken to the streets in Kenya, Mozambique and elsewhere to protest against governments they see as corrupt and incompetent.</p><h3>The bad and the ugly</h3><p>African politics is subject to the same forces as elsewhere. When governments do a bad job, citizens want them out. Yet there are certain aspects of the political economy in many African countries that seem especially bad for growth, making it harder to close the Africa gap. The first is the weakness of the state. Most African countries are autocracies of one sort or another; the <small>EIU</small>, our sister outfit, classifies just six of the 54 countries as full or flawed democracies. That can bring to mind the idea of all-powerful, ever-present government. The reality is different. African states are often incapable of doing the things a state should do, while doing plenty of things that it should not.</p><p>Whether it is the provision of security and basic services or the collection of taxes, Africa is under-governed. Less than half of babies have their births registered in sub-Saharan Africa. Congo has not had a census in 40 years. The <small>IMF</small> estimates that in sub-Saharan countries tax revenues make up 13% of <small>GDP</small> on average, against 18% in other emerging and developing countries and 27% in rich countries. The number of public-sector workers as a share of the population is lower in sub-Saharan Africa than in any other region. When Afrobarometer asks Africans to name the most important problems they face, the issues they mention are things taken for granted elsewhere: clean water, electricity, roads, food and security.</p><p>A capable state matters for economic growth. Ricardo Hausmann of the Growth Lab at Harvard University argues that African states struggle to ensure &#8220;complementarity between private and public goods&#8221;. In 2023 the Growth Lab estimated that failing utilities were responsible for 40% of the South Africa&#8217;s recent economic underperformance. State shortcomings put off investors. Sameh Shenoudah of the Africa Finance Corporation, a Lagos-based financial institution, says he tells his dealmakers they need to consider how any exporter they invest in is going to get its goods out. &#8220;Don&#8217;t bring me a project, bring me an evacuation plan,&#8221; is his message.</p><p>At the same time African policymakers have less margin for error than those in other parts of the world. Picking the wrong infrastructure project matters more if you have funding for only a few. The margin of error is also narrow when it comes to adapting to a warming planet. Poor countries are more vulnerable to volatile weather because they are less resilient. They do not have paved roads, high building standards and ample cold storage. The World Meteorological Organisation, a <small>UN</small> agency, estimates that in sub-Saharan Africa the cost of adaptation will be $30-50bn per year over the next decade, or 2-3% of <small>GDP</small>. This is money that most African countries do not have.</p><p>Yet it is also true that many African countries do not help themselves. There are more subtle ways in which African governments undermine development. A research project led by Nic Cheeseman of the University of Birmingham has mapped what it calls &#8220;Africa&#8217;s shadow states&#8221;. These are made up of parasitical networks through which businessmen get sweetheart deals in exchange for funding politicians or accepting kickbacks. This was the model on catastrophic display in South Africa under Jacob Zuma.</p><p>And there is a yet more subtle cost. If secure property rights depend on the whims of African leaders, they last only as long as the Big Man is in office. This discourages long-term investment. Ken Opalo, a Kenyan academic at Georgetown University, in Washington, <small>DC</small>, argues that when politicians and businessmen do not keep to their &#8220;lanes&#8221; it makes for the worst of both worlds. &#8220;The fusion of lanes makes it difficult for elites to specialise in either business or politics, resulting in a region full of mediocre politicians and politically dependent mediocre businesspeople.&#8221;</p><h3>Looking for bargains</h3><p>The closeness of business and politics also helps explain why there are so few African entrepreneurs of global standing, and so few globally competitive African firms. It is hard to become a legitimate billionaire when wealth depends on politics. It also encourages Africans with cash to stash it offshore. Perhaps 30% of African wealth is held outside the continent, compared with a global average of 8%, according to (somewhat old) estimates by Gabriel Zucman, an economist.</p><p>Stefan Dercon of Oxford University, a former chief economist at Britain&#8217;s Department for International Development, sees rebooting relationships and attitudes among elites as the key to progress. The shared characteristic of successful countries, he argues, is not a particular set of policies. &#8220;Successful countries appear to have pursued a relatively diverse set of economic and other policies&#8221;. It is that political and business elites have agreed on an implicit pact that prioritises increasing the size of the economic pie over simply gobbling it all up, as they did before. Mr Dercon calls this a &#8220;development bargain&#8221;, and argues that the agreement such bargains produce on the path forward matters more than what the path actually is.</p><p>Mr Dercon points to India, Bangladesh and Vietnam as examples of Asian countries that were as poor as many in Africa today, but found the right elite consensus. He argues that Ethiopia and Rwanda, both of which grew at 7% per year for much of the past three decades, are African examples of regimes that had such bargains. He suggests that Uganda, Kenya and Ghana may have the ingredients to forge deals, too.</p><p>You could add a few others. At independence, in 1968, Mauritius was a poor plantation economy. Its first government cut a deal with the sugar barons to invest in manufacturing. That provided the foundation for the island&#8217;s future success in tourism and services as well. The decent growth in the first 15 years after apartheid in South Africa can be seen partly as the result of a pact between the new black political elite and the mostly white capitalist class.</p><p>It is easy to quibble with the idea of development bargains. There is a risk of circular logic where any country that grows very fast ought to put its success down to an elite deal of some sorts. The bargain is an easier thing to describe after the fact than to outline ahead of time. In neither Ethiopia, which has recently had a civil war, nor Rwanda, where Paul Kagame rules with an iron fist, do the elite bargains seem durable.</p><p>Yet Mr Dercon&#8217;s insight ought to be galvanising for African policymakers. It suggests that African countries need not be defined by their histories; they could be defined by their futures. And it suggests that the African politicians can do more than just copy and paste the ideas they see abroad, whether in the West or in East Asia. Yuen Yuen Ang, a Singaporean academic who wrote &#8220;How China Escaped The Poverty Trap&#8221;, an influential book that emphasises the idiosyncratic interplay between government and market forces, argues that the lesson from China for Africa is about &#8220;using what you have&#8221;. &#8220;As someone coming from a post-colonial country, I know what it&#8217;s like when great powers tell you that you have nothing. Believing in yourself is a necessary first step to transformation.&#8221;</p><p class="end has-stop">Whether African elites are willing and able to strike such bargains is unclear. The model of divvying up rents extracted by foreign firms has worked fine for many of them in the past. For this to change, African elites either need a new mindset&#8212;or a change of incentives, making it in their self-interest to gamble on development. The bargains Mr Dercon describes have often been struck when regimes face existential threats to their legitimacy. And there is no shortage of those on the continent, whether in the form of climate change or the 15m young people entering the workforce every year, the vast majority of whom will not get a formal job. African policymakers say that keeps them up at night. Yet many seem as if they are yet to truly wake up to it.</p>
