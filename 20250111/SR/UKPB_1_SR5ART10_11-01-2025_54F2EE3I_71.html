        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">A</span><small>FRICAN POLICYMAKERS</small> love to champion their continent&#8217;s entrepreneurs. For Paul Kagame, Rwanda&#8217;s president, small and medium enterprises are the &#8220;backbone of Africa&#8217;s economy&#8221;. &#8220;We must support the youth to go beyond looking for jobs,&#8221; says Akinwumi Adesina, the head of the African Development Bank (<small>A</small>f<small>DB</small>).</p><p>Such bigwigs like to point to data that seem to show how unusually entrepreneurial Africa is. The African Youth Survey, a regular poll, suggests that 71% of young Africans plan to start a business. Male leaders also like to congratulate themselves on how more than a quarter of adult women have started, or are starting, a business&#8212;the highest share of any continent, according to data cited by the <small>A</small>f<small>DB</small>.</p><p>Yet much of this praise amounts to misplaced virtue-signalling. Though there are African entrepreneurs founding innovative startups in everything from fintech to commercial agriculture, running a business is often the result of desperation, not choice. To close the gap with the rest of the world, Africa does not need more small businesses. It needs more large ones. Large firms are productivity powerhouses. They bring people, ideas, technology and equipment together in ways that make workers more efficient, which makes people richer.</p><figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250111_SRC253.png"></div></figure><p>McKinsey estimates that there are 345 firms in Africa with revenues over $1bn (China has about 1,500). Yet the consultancy noted in a report in 2018 that, excluding South Africa, Africa has only around 60% of the large firms one would expect, given the overall size of the countries&#8217; economies. Those large firms are also not as large as the ones found in other emerging regions. Taken together, adds McKinsey, the total revenue pool of African firms (excluding South Africa) is &#8220;about a third of what it could be&#8221;. Africa is the only inhabited continent without any of the world&#8217;s 500 biggest firms, as compiled by <i>Fortune</i>, a magazine.</p><p>Other research suggests that African firms employ fewer people than businesses do elsewhere. A paper by Leonardo Iacovone, Vijaya Ramachandran and Martin Schmidt, three economists, albeit from a decade ago, estimated that African firms employ between a fifth and a quarter less people than firms of the same age in other countries, even after controlling for the size of the market where they operate. Karthik Tadepalli of the University of California, Berkeley, says that, in America, firms &#8220;either grow or die&#8221;. Those that are still around ten years after their founding typically employ three times as many people as when they started. Unfortunately, in many developing countries, including African ones, firms grow very slowly, often barely adding workers over time.</p><p>Instead of many large firms with salaried staff, Africa has lots of micro-enterprises and informal workers. More than 80% of employment in Africa is informal, according to the International Labour Organisation. Roughly half of informal workers in cities are self-employed, doing everything from crafting Instagram advertising to fixing roofs. Many Africans mix formal work with informal hustles, which are often poorly paid. Most would love a steady job. Mr Tadepalli suggests that many of the &#8220;self-employed&#8221; may just be the unemployed &#8220;in disguise&#8221;.</p><p>Informal work is common in all poor countries. Data from the 2010s suggest that African cities had similar shares of informality to Indian cities. But Africa seems different in two ways: it has a relatively high share of informal self-employment, and the likelihood of a young person entering informal work does not seem to be diminishing.</p><p>In 2022 Oriana Bandiera of the <small>LSE</small> and co-authors compared the sorts of work done by 18- to 24-year-olds in various parts of the world. Young Africans, they found, are more likely to do unpaid work and not to have an employer than their peers in other developing countries. They also found that young Africans are not any more likely to hold a salaried job than older Africans. &#8220;The jobs of many young people in Africa do not differ from [those] of their parents&#8217; generation.&#8221;</p><h3>Small is unproductive</h3><p>Part of the problem is poor education. Mass literacy has been a precursor to take-off growth in many parts of the world. Reading helps people follow instructions in a factory or a call centre. Yet while primary-school enrolement has risen in sub-Saharan Africa in the past 25 years, some 60% of 15- to 17-year-olds are not in school. Literacy rates for 15- to 24-year-olds are around 75% across the region. The average for other developing regions is 90%.</p><p>But the problem is bigger than that: there are simply not enough jobs for young people. There is a risk of a &#8220;vicious cycle&#8221;, argues Ms Bandiera, &#8220;where most people run subsistence enterprises because there are no salaried jobs and there are no salaried jobs because most enterprises operate at subsistence levels.&#8221; As Paul Collier of Oxford University says, &#8220;Small isn&#8217;t stunning. It&#8217;s unproductive.&#8221;</p><figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250111_SRC248.png"></div></figure><p>The World Bank surveys firms from around the world about what they see as their biggest obstacle. The results point to something akin to the business version of Maslow&#8217;s hierarchy of needs. In sub-Saharan Africa the two most commonly cited obstacles are the basics every growing firm needs: capital and electricity. In each case firms from the region are more likely to cite these barriers than those anywhere else. (A lack of &#8220;educated workers&#8221; is one of the least commonly cited obstacles in sub-Saharan Africa.)</p><p>Access to finance is the main constraint cited by firms. Less than 10% of those with under 20 employees use bank financing. Making Finance Work for Africa, an <small>NGO</small> , reckons that just 20% of all firms have a bank loan or a line of credit, the lowest share of any continent. The ratio of credit to <small>GDP</small> in sub-Saharan Africa is half of that found in South Asia and Latin America.</p><p>Small wonder when it costs so much to borrow. The average lending interest rate (the rate banks charge firms to meet short- and medium-term needs) for the 19 African countries for which the <small>IMF</small> had data in 2023 was 25%. In India and Vietnam, it was around 9%. In some African countries business people face even higher rates. On a visit to Accra your correspondent visited Muina Wosornu, founder of Prête Cashews, a snacks firm. She has relied on financing from friends and family. Asked how much it would cost to take out a bank loan, she calls up a banker who says, over the speakerphone, that it would be six to ten percentage points above the base rate, which at the time was 29%.</p><p>One reason for high rates is a lack of competition among banks. Their net-interest margins are the highest of any region. Research by the <small>IMF</small> shows that markups in sub-Saharan Africa are on average 11% higher than in other developing regions, suggesting that firms have outsize market power and are shielded from competition from startups.</p><p>Rates would also be lower if there were more savings to go around. But the domestic savings rate in sub-Saharan Africa from 2010 to 2021 was just 19%, against 37% in East Asia. This is partly a demographic story: when fertility rates are high there are more mouths to feed and less money to save. But some analysts caution that in parts of Africa, savings rates have remained low even as fertility rates have dipped, suggesting that other factors matter, too.</p><p>Stagnant economies do not help. Neither does a rational aversion to saving cash in countries with histories of high inflation or, as was recently the case in Ghana, state-enforced restructuring of pensions because of a debt crisis. Many Africans continue to see land and property (and in some cases cattle) as more reliable places to store wealth. Though the rise in fintech firms should make it easier to save, the shallowness of capital markets means there can also be a lack of investment options. On a recent trip to Angola your correspondent sat in on a talk by a young investor who pitched to his peers on investing in the local stock exchange. It will be hard for them to diversify their portfolios, though: there are only four listed firms.</p><p>Then there is electricity, the second most commonly cited obstacle. Energy for Growth Hub, another think-tank, found that 78% of firms in Africa experienced annual power cuts in 2018, and that 41% identified electricity as a major constraint to their operations, the highest of any region. African firms lose on average the equivalent of 25 days of economic activity a year through power cuts. Justice Mensah of the World Bank last year estimated that Ghana&#8217;s power crisis of 2013-16 increased the unemployment rate by five percentage points, because it stunted incumbents and made it harder for new businesses to get started. Other research shows that firms in poor countries subject to power cuts have lower productivity growth than those with a steady supply, because it stops them using their capital equipment.</p><p>Other inadequate infrastructure also matters. The cost of transporting goods in Ethiopia and Nigeria, for instance, is 3.5 and 5.3 times that of America, according to analysis by David Atkin and Dave Donaldson, two economists. Sub-Saharan Africa has a road density of only about a fifth of the global average, and only about a quarter of roads are paved. When markets, domestic or regional, are poorly integrated, firms&#8217; growth prospects are constrained.</p><p>To see the difference good infrastructure makes visit Vertical Agro, a processing firm in Kenya. It just became the first company anywhere to sell frozen avocados to China, an achievement that would have been impossible without reliable electricity for freezing. (That electricity, like most of Kenya&#8217;s, is from renewable sources, which should also help the firm export frozen vegetables into regions implementing cross-border carbon taxes, such as the <small>EU</small>.) Being located near farms, major roads, a railway and Nairobi&#8217;s airport means goods can get to market swiftly. &#8220;If you come back in 25 years this whole valley will be full of factories,&#8221; says Tiku Shah, the firm&#8217;s boss. </p><p>Other research points to the role of market frictions in keeping African enterprises small. A study in Uganda found that when farmers were given a digital platform that allowed them to sell their goods to a wider group of buyers, they increased their revenues. It is no coincidence that some of the biggest conglomerates in Africa today, including Dangote, a Nigerian company run by Aliko Dangote, Africa&#8217;s richest man, started out as trading firms. Having access to granular market intelligence when information is scarce allowed them to build businesses serving demand about which others did not know.</p><p class="end has-stop">Yet boosting the size, number and productivity of African firms is not simply a case of overcoming market failures. Business in Africa can be highly political, in ways that undermine the continent&#8217;s growth. </p>
