        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">S</span><small>OON AFTER</small> Olaf Scholz defied the odds to win election as German chancellor in 2021, his jubilant party colleagues exulted over the coming &#8220;decade of social democracy&#8221;. Now he is set to fall having served barely a third of that. In the run-up to an election on February 23rd, polls give 16% to Mr Scholz&#8217;s Social Democrats (<small>SPD</small>), placing them a distant third behind the centre-right Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian ally, the Christian Social Union, or <small>CDU</small>/<small>CSU</small> (31%), and the hard-right Alternative for Germany (20%). Germany&#8217;s economy is in the doldrums, war and uncertainty stalk the land, and voters are anxious. Yet as the <small>SPD</small> prepares to anoint Mr Scholz its candidate on January 11th, the chancellor&#8217;s camp think their man can pull it off again. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be hard but there&#8217;s absolutely a chance,&#8221; says Dorothee Martin, an <small>SPD</small><small>MP</small> from Mr Scholz&#8217;s home town of Hamburg.</p><p>The case proceeds like this. First, consider the previous election. Written off in 2021 as he is today, Mr Scholz executed a perfectly pitched campaign and led the <small>SPD</small> to overcome the <small>CDU</small>/ <small>CSU</small>&#8217;s double-digit lead in its final weeks. Where pundits see only opinion polls, argue Mr Scholz&#8217;s aides, he retains a deeper instinct for the subterranean currents of German politics. Slow and steady wins the race.</p><p>Second, look at the opposition. Mr Scholz may be the most unpopular chancellor of modern times. But his main opponent, Friedrich Merz, the <small>CDU</small>/<small>CSU</small> candidate, fares little better (see chart), and he is prone to gaffes. Crucially, notes a Scholz aide, the more voters see of Mr Merz the less they like him; and many are only now tuning into the election, after a snap vote precipitated by the demise of the three-party coalition in November. Anyway, say his team, Mr Scholz&#8217;s unpopularity has more to do with that detested government than his own deficiencies. Expect a personalised campaign: the cool-headed Mr Scholz v the irascible, untested Mr Merz.</p><figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250111_EUC325.png"></div></figure><p>Third, peer ahead. The last month of Germany&#8217;s campaign will be the first of Donald Trump&#8217;s presidency, and Mr Trump will surely give voters reason to notice. A campaign now focused on wages, industry and immigration may in part turn on who can best respond to American tariffs, a proposed peace deal in Ukraine or demands to triple the defence budget. So far the <small>SPD</small> campaign has been about unflashy reassurance: pay, pensions, investment and energy costs. This modest approach seems out of kilter with the scale of Germany&#8217;s challenges. But party strategists hope it will leave Mr Scholz well placed to present himself as the rock in whatever storm Mr Trump unleashes after January 20th. &#8220;Today &#8216;change&#8217; and &#8216;progress&#8217; sound like threats,&#8221; says Armand Zorn, an <small>SPD</small> <small>MP</small> from Frankfurt. &#8220;Voters want stability and security.&#8221;</p><p>Can this really work? Mr Scholz may well make up ground in the campaign; the <small>SPD</small> usually does when trailing the <small>CDU</small>/<small>CSU</small>. Although the chancellor&#8217;s governing style is plodding in the extreme, he enjoys playing the underdog and can be surprisingly effective on the stump, notes Daniel Brössler, author of &#8220;A German Chancellor&#8221;, a biography of Mr Scholz. As for Mr Trump, to risk-averse Germans Mr Scholz&#8217;s safety-first approach could prove more appealing than Mr Merz&#8217;s more macho style.</p><p>Yet for all that, the odds against a Scholz re-election look almost insurmountable. The lessons from 2021 are limited, says Peter Matuschek, of Forsa, a pollster. Mr Merz is more popular than Armin Laschet, the previous <small>CDU</small>/<small>CSU</small> candidate, and Mr Scholz is both better known and less liked today. Just 8% of Germans think the <small>SPD</small> is best placed to manage the country&#8217;s problems. Unlike in 2021, when Mr Scholz was an electoral asset for his party, today he is a drag on its support. Seen in that light, the <small>SPD</small>&#8217;s decision to plaster his visage all over its posters may seem bold.</p><p class="end has-stop">So, for some, was the choice to run with Mr Scholz in the first place. Last year the <small>SPD</small> flirted with the idea of replacing him with Boris Pistorius, the popular defence minister, whose decision to withdraw from contention in November hurt the morale of some <small>SPD</small> foot-soldiers who did not relish the prospect of a winter campaign canvassing for a weak candidate. The chancellor himself appears to have inexhaustible reserves of self-belief. Someone has to: 62% of the <small>SPD</small>&#8217;s own supporters believe he will lose to Mr Merz. </p>
