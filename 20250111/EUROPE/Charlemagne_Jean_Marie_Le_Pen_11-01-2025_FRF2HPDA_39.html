        <section class="article__body">
          <figure class="media media--drawing media--wide"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250111_EUD000.png"></div></figure><p><span data-caps="initial">H</span><small>E LIVED HIS</small> life in lurid colour. But it often felt as if Jean-Marie Le Pen, who died on January 7th at the age of 96, belonged to an era of black and white. There was Indochina (where he served as a paratrooper); French Algeria (where he fought for the homeland, and admitted to torture); the French Fourth Republic (during which he was first elected to the National Assembly, in 1956, two years before Charles de Gaulle wrote the modern constitution). Even Mr Le Pen&#8217;s 19th-century mansion, perched magnificently on a ridge overlooking Paris, appeared to be the product of decades of neglect; its walls were dark brown, furniture shabby and it &#8220;stank of death&#8221;, noted Yann, his middle daughter. Like Mr Le Pen&#8217;s unapologetic extremist politics, the far-right leader&#8217;s formative moments seem to belong to history. Yet his influence on French politics could hardly be more current.</p><p>Little about Mr Le Pen&#8217;s life was tempered. With his broad frame and bombastic manner, the son of a Brittany fisherman thundered through life without a filter. He relished public provocation, which often landed him in court, just as he did belting out Breton sea shanties at the family mansion after a boozy dinner. Given a platform Mr Le Pen would rant against anything&#8212;fists punched into the air, articulation precise&#8212;even the country&#8217;s winning multi-ethnic football team (too many &#8220;foreigners&#8221;). An apologist for PÃ©tain&#8217;s collaborationist regime, he was periodically convicted: for hate speech, antisemitism and denying crimes against humanity, the latter after claiming that the Nazi gas chambers were a &#8220;detail&#8221; of the history of the second world war.</p><p>In two respects in particular, Mr Le Pen was also a precursor for today&#8217;s nationalist-populist right. In the 1950s he was first drawn into politics by Pierre Poujade, a proto-populist whose movement represented shopkeepers, tradesmen, artisans and &#8220;the little people&#8221;. His was the politics of the &#8220;downtrodden&#8221; against the elite, which finds a wide echo today. As co-founder of the National Front in 1972, Mr Le Pen was also a proponent of &#8220;great replacement&#8221; thinking, long before it became a fashionable theory for the far right. From his study in the mansion above Paris, filled with nautical memorabilia, it was almost as if he imagined himself to be single-handedly commanding the country&#8217;s maritime defences. There, beside brass-mounted binoculars and model frigates, Mr Le Pen once held forth to this columnist about the upcoming &#8220;submersion&#8221; of France by an &#8220;invasion&#8221; of &#8220;all the miserable populations of the world&#8221;. &#8220;We lived through German military occupation, but afterwards they left,&#8221; he roared at her; &#8220;immigrant populations have no intention of leaving.&#8221;</p><p>Ultimately, Mr Le Pen&#8217;s unfiltered approach was too much even for his own daughter, Marine Le Pen, who took over the party in 2011. Four years later she expelled her father, and then changed its name, to the National Rally. It was a seminal political moment, and a brutal, humiliating personal disavowal. Ambition triumphed over affection; rivalry overrode filial duty. All his life, Mr Le Pen thrived on conflict; Ms Le Pen sought to appear respectable. He swaggered about on the untouchable fringes of polite society; she dines coolly at upscale Parisian restaurants. He never really sought political power; she wants to govern France.</p><p>The trace that Mr Le Pen left on French politics was noxious and incremental, but not as linear as it appears in some telling&#8212;and not all of his own making. The political cynicism of his adversaries also played a part. The <i>lepÃ©nisation</i> of French minds, or the spread of his core discourse, began to take hold in the 1980s. But it was FranÃ§ois Mitterrand, then the Socialist president, who changed the electoral rules to favour small parties, in an attempt to split the right. In 1986 Mr Le Pen and his group of assorted extremists, nativists and colonial apologists secured a record 35 parliamentary seats, before losing all but one when the rules changed again two years later. Indeed the very toxicity of Mr Le Pen&#8217;s extremism served the left, prompting an anti-racism movement that bred a new generation of politicians and helped Mitterrand to win re-election. A serene debate about controlled immigration in France has been difficult ever since.</p><h3>Le Pen is mightier</h3><p>For Ms Le Pen the moment has never seemed so favourable. The best Mr Le Pen ever managed in his five runs for the presidency was 18% in 2002, when he shocked France by making it into the second round against Jacques Chirac. Twenty years later, in the run-off against the centrist Emmanuel Macron, Ms Le Pen scored 41.5%. The judges may yet keep her from running for office, when they decide on March 31st whether to rule her ineligible in a trial over the misuse of public funds. Barring this, she looks better placed than ever. Mr Macron, who has twice kept her from power at the ballot box, cannot run again at the next presidential election, due in 2027; no clear successor has yet emerged. If he calls fresh parliamentary elections this summer, Ms Le Pen&#8217;s party could enter government earlier still.</p><p>In the end, Mr Le Pen&#8217;s legacy is also hers: the normalisation of anti-immigrant nationalist politics. Mr Le Pen may have belonged to the toxic fringe. But he also laid the foundations for a form of politics which, purged of its extreme imagery and elements, has become mainstream, in France and Europe. Today its champions hold power (Italy, Hungary, Slovakia), or share it, in over half a dozen countries. The <i>lepÃ©nisation</i> of minds has spread even to places, such as Germany, once thought immune.</p><p class="end has-stop">Two decades ago Mr Le Pen&#8217;s brand of xenophobic politics was rejected by a majority of French, and European, public opinion. Today Ms Le Pen is one of the most popular politicians in France. Ms Le Pen had to turn on her father to get to where she is today. But she would not be there if he had not come first. </p>
