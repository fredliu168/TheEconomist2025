          <p><span data-caps="initial">I</span><small>N 1937, WHEN</small> Benito Mussolini, then Italy&#8217;s fascist leader, opened Cinecittà, a sprawling film complex in Rome, his government adopted a variant of a slogan first ascribed to Lenin: &#8220;Cinematography is the most powerful weapon.&#8221; On January 10th that weapon was turned with relish against any who might be tempted to follow in the dictator&#8217;s footsteps. Sky Italia, a satellite-<small>TV</small> platform, began televising &#8220;<i>M&#8212;Il Figlio del Secolo</i>&#8221; (&#8221;M&#8212;Son of the Century&#8221;), an eight-part dramatisation of Mussolini&#8217;s rise to power. The work of a British director, Joe Wright, it is based on a bestselling novel by Antonio Scurati. The series has dazzled critics. Angela Calvini wrote in <i>Avvenire</i>, a Catholic daily, that &#8220;its incisive, unsettling cinematographic style leaves [one] truly speechless.&#8221;</p><p>The violence it depicts will shock many Italians who have been lulled into believing that Mussolini&#8217;s rule was pretty harmless. &#8220;Mussolini never killed anyone,&#8221; declared Italy&#8217;s late prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi. &#8220;Mussolini used to send people on holiday in internal exile.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;M&#8221; is not just a bloodstained period drama, though. It is a cautionary tale of the seductive power of authoritarianism. It opens with Mussolini, played by Luca Marinelli, telling viewers: &#8220;There is always a time when lost peoples lean towards simple ideas [and] the wise brutality of strong men.&#8221; That is a controversial message in a country whose voters have handed power to a party, the Brothers of Italy (<small>F</small>d<small>I</small>), with roots in neo-fascism. Conservatives have bristled at the implied comparison.</p><p>Giorgia Meloni, the prime minister and leader of the <small>F</small>d<small>I</small>, does not seek a fascist dictatorship. Her policies have been solidly Atlanticist and no more radical than those of many other conservative governments. But with Donald Trump about to re-enter the White House, she may be tempted by a more radical approach. Ms Meloni is friendly with Elon Musk, a major backer of Mr Trump. On January 4th she made an unannounced visit to Mr Trump&#8217;s Mar-a-Lago residence. The incoming president called her &#8220;a fantastic woman&#8221;.</p><p class="end has-stop">With hard-right parties in government or sharing power in half a dozen European countries, the relevance of &#8220;M&#8221; goes beyond Italy. Its depiction of the storming by Mussolini&#8217;s militia of the Socialist daily <i>Avanti!</i> recalls the assault on America&#8217;s Capitol four years ago. At a dinner, the future dictator tells guests: &#8220;We are an anti-party. We practise anti-politics.&#8221; And inside parliament, he offers the most enduring message of all. &#8220;Democracy is lovely,&#8221; he tells viewers. &#8220;It gives you a load of freedoms. Even the freedom to destroy it.&#8221;</p>
