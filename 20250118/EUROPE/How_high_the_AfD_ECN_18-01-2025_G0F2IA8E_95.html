        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">I</span><small>T IS A</small> bitingly cold evening in Bautzen, a handsome town nestled in the hills of the Oberlausitz, deep in the east German state of Saxony. But spirits are high at the election stand of the hard-right Alternative for Germany (<small>A</small>f<small>D</small>). &#8220;Our land first, because we love Germany!&#8221; proclaim banners in the party&#8217;s trademark bright blue. &#8220;The mood inside the party is really good,&#8221; beams Frank Peschel, who sits in Saxony&#8217;s parliament. The <small>A</small>f<small>D</small> took 39% of the vote here at last year&#8217;s European election, and your correspondent struggles to find any local not planning to vote for it at the national election on February 23rd. &#8220;The left calls us Nazis, but we just want a normal life,&#8221; says Simon, a 20-year-old. He will deliver his first vote to the party next month.</p><p>There is a swagger to the <small>A</small>f<small>D</small> these days. Having fallen back in early 2024, the party has engineered a well-timed recovery. Its current polling, at around 20% and climbing, could double its representation in the Bundestag. Party spirits have been lifted by events in Austria, where an <small>A</small>f<small>D</small>-like party is set for power after a centrist attempt to block it fell apart. Elon Musk, a plutocrat close to Donald Trump, recently conducted a rambling interview with Alice Weidel, the <small>A</small>f<small>D</small>&#8217;s co-chair. Party insiders cringed, but say his endorsement will spark the interest of younger voters and German business, many parts of which remain deeply <small>A</small>f<small>D</small>-sceptical. Once-bitter divisions inside the party have been muted in the service of election discipline&#8212;largely in favour of its more radical wing.</p><p>This points to a puzzle. Comparable hard-right outfits in Europe, like the National Rally in France or Giorgia Meloni&#8217;s Brothers of Italy, have moderated to broaden their appeal. But the <small>A</small>f<small>D</small> has grown even as it radicalises. At its pre-election conference in Saxony last weekend Ms Weidel, an ex-banker once seen as a comparative moderate, thrilled delegates with a red-meat speech culminating in a call for the &#8220;remigration&#8221; of illegal migrants, a controversial term she lustily emphasised. The party anointed her its first-ever candidate for the chancellery: a signal of its confidence, if not an ambition that will be fulfilled any time soon. &#8220; <i>Alice für Deutschland!</i>&#8221; hollered the crowd, a pun on &#8220; <i>Alles für Deutschland</i>&#8221;, a banned Nazi-era slogan. &#8220;There aren&#8217;t really any moderates left in the party,&#8221; says Anna-Sophie Heinze, a political scientist at the University of Trier.</p><p>The <small>A</small>f<small>D</small>&#8217;s rebound has been powered by the government&#8217;s failures on migration, energy prices and the economy, says Tino Chrupalla, who shares the leadership with Ms Weidel. Just 22% of Germans think the country is up to the challenges of the future. The <small>A</small>f<small>D</small> is honing its message for angry voters, muffling issues that excite passions inside the party but have little broader appeal, such as quitting the <small>EU</small>, while playing up concerns over immigration and energy. Yet speaking out of both sides of its mouth is essential to its success. Scandals help: in the latest, an <small>A</small>f<small>D</small> branch distributed election flyers in the form of fake plane tickets pledging to deport illegal immigrants, a stunt with roots in the Nazi era. The party says it simply wants adherence to the law. But the dog-whistle is audible. &#8220;Yes, our rhetoric has sharpened,&#8221; says Mr Chrupalla. &#8220;But we just reflect political reality. People are fed up.&#8221;</p><p>The <small>A</small>f<small>D</small>&#8217;s electorate has grown more heterogeneous as its support has risen. In parts of the east it commands well over a third of the vote, yet it has far more voters in the (larger) west. The archetypal <small>A</small>f<small>D</small> voter is a middle-aged blue-collar worker in a small town, but the party is making inroads among youngsters. Its voters are not notably poor members of the &#8220;left behind&#8221;. But they tend to see themselves as badly off. The <small>A</small>f<small>D</small>&#8217;s big weakness is with female voters, and candidates: just one in nine in next month&#8217;s election is a woman.</p><p><small>A</small>f<small>D</small> voters tend to be loyal. Most do not see themselves as radical. Instead, many regard other parties, including the conservative Christian Democrats (<small>CDU</small>), as having gone soft. But they are disproportionately likely to hold extremist views, including tolerance towards political violence (see chart). The party is under surveillance by domestic spooks for &#8220;suspected right-wing extremism&#8221;. More than 100 <small>MP</small>s have backed a proposal to ban it.</p><figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250118_EUC394.png"></div></figure><p>It is surely too late for that. But the <small>A</small>f<small>D</small> does remain locked out of power. Elsewhere in Europe, centre-right parties&#8217; firewalls against the hard right have tumbled. But Friedrich Merz, head of the <small>CDU</small> and Germany&#8217;s probable next chancellor, says to work with the <small>A</small>f<small>D</small> would be to &#8220;sell the <small>CDU</small>&#8217;s soul&#8221;. In eastern states the <small>CDU</small> has formed ideologically outlandish coalitions to keep it out. Many Germans turned off by the party&#8217;s fascist aura vote tactically for its opponents. The anti-<small>A</small>f<small>D</small> firewall may even have advanced the party&#8217;s radicalisation by removing an incentive to moderate.</p><p>Few <small>A</small>f<small>D</small> insiders think its polling can get much higher this time around. Yet no one in the party thinks it can be blocked from power for ever. &#8220;If you make firewalls, you&#8217;ll get burned behind them,&#8221; says Mr Chrupalla about the <small>CDU</small>. And although Mr Merz has tacked right, he will probably have to govern with a leftist party in coalition. That, says Krzysztof Walczak, from the <small>A</small>f<small>D</small>&#8217;s Hamburg branch, means he will be unable to deliver his promised (and <small>A</small>f<small>D</small>-adjacent) policies, such as rejecting asylum-seekers at Germany&#8217;s borders. The party is campaigning hard on this message.</p><p class="end has-stop">The firewall is most at risk in the east. Mr Chrupalla expects a new <small>CDU</small>-led minority government in Saxony to fall apart, presenting an opening. An election next year in Saxony-Anhalt, another <small>A</small>f<small>D</small> stronghold, looks appetising. Nationally the task is harder; Mr Merz knows the risks of even hinting at an opening to the <small>A</small>f<small>D</small>. But his aides fear that if they fail to get on top of Germany&#8217;s problems, notably illegal immigration and economic stagnation, the <small>A</small>f<small>D</small> could win the next election in 2029. That would not necessarily open the door to power. But it would be a grim milestone. </p>
