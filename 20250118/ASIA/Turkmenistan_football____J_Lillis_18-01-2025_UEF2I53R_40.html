        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">A</span><small>RKADAG ARE</small> the undisputed champions of Turkmenistan. Founded in 2023, the football (soccer) team won every match in its first two domestic seasons, ending a hot streak of 61 straight wins only in November, with a loss to Kuwait&#8217;s Al-Arabi in an international game. The team came close to the all-time record set by Scotland&#8217;s Celtic <small>FC</small> just over a century ago, undefeated for 62 games. But some of Celtic&#8217;s matches were draws. Arkadag can still claim the longest winning streak.</p><p>Yet Guinness World Records, a chronicler of such achievements, has denied Arkadag due recognition, granting the honour instead to Saudi Arabia&#8217;s Al-Hilal, which boasts just 34 straight wins. Doubts about the Turkmen league&#8217;s governance made it impossible to verify Arkadag&#8217;s claim. Still, the self-reported streak is a remarkable feat. What is the key to Arkadag&#8217;s success?</p><p>The clue is in the name. &#8220;Arkadag&#8221;, meaning &#8220;Protector&#8221;, is also the honorific of Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, Turkmenistan&#8217;s president from 2006 to 2022 and still the power behind the throne now occupied by his son, Serdar. The pair rule in tandem, though the father&#8217;s ebullient personality eclipses his dour son&#8217;s. Berdymukhamedov the elder is an action man, with a love of racing-cars and horses, the national symbol of Turkmenistan. A talented crooner as well as a high-performing sportsman, he once celebrated Turkmenistan&#8217;s annual horse festival by rapping a paean to the steed with his grandson. Like the team that bears his title, he tends to win any contest he enters.</p><p>The sports-mad potentate oversaw the design of Arkadag&#8217;s strip and logo (a white horse), and its state-of-the-art stadium sitting, naturally, in a place called Arkadag. The town boasts a 40-metre-tall statue of its namesake (the ex-president, not the football team) and a main street called Akhan, after his favourite horse. Hence Arkadag, the leader, goes to Arkadag, the town, to watch Arkadag, the football team.</p><p class="end has-stop">Not everyone in Turkmenistan is pleased with the team&#8217;s triumphs. There were mutterings of foul play after Arkadag poached players from other teams. There are suspicions that referees favour the newcomers. Despite&#8212;or perhaps because of&#8212;all that, Arkadag&#8217;s sporting future looks rosy. The Protector will, after all, live up to his name.</p>
