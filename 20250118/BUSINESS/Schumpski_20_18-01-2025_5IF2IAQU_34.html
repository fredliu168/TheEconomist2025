        <section class="article__body">
          <figure class="media media--drawing media--wide"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250118_WBD000.png"></div></figure><p><span data-caps="initial">&#8220;Y</span><small>OU LOOK</small> thicker&#8221; sounds like a slight. Coming from Joe Rogan, the thick-set podcasting megastar and martial artist, it is high praise. Directed at Mark Zuckerberg, the uber-nerd behind Meta&#8217;s $1.5trn social-media empire, it may seem highly misplaced. But it is true. Mr Zuckerberg does look beefier than five years ago. During the covid-19 pandemic he got into Brazilian jiu-jitsu, a rough combat sport. Now he would like to see more &#8220;masculine energy&#8221; in the corporate world, too.</p><p>A few days before he sat down with Mr Rogan, Mr Zuckerberg invited Dana White, chief executive of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (<small>UFC</small>), to Meta&#8217;s board. No other big sport league reeks more of testosterone than the <small>UFC</small>, in which fighters square off in an eight-sided ring, (almost) no holds barred. Few American business figures ooze in-your-face masculinity more than the bald, bulky and brash Mr White. And not even Elon Musk is as close to America&#8217;s alpha-male-in-chief.</p><p>Some observers point to Mr White&#8217;s decades-long friendship with Donald Trump as proof that Mr Zuckerberg&#8217;s newly thick neck conceals a weak spine. Meta has been the target of Trumpian ire since it banned the former president from Facebook and Instagram after his bogus claims of a stolen election led his followers to sack the Capitol four years ago. Having someone with a direct line to the White House, where Mr Trump will be moving back in on January 20th, is therefore mightily convenient.</p><p>This no doubt occurred to Mr Zuckerberg. Yet making Mr White&#8217;s elevation at Meta out to be purely about toadying is to give neither man his due. Whatever you think of his neck or spine, Mr Zuckerberg has a head for commerce. He rightly sees in the <small>UFC</small> a growth business&#8212;and in Mr White a canny businessman.</p><p>A Boston street brawler and amateur boxer turned gym operator in Las Vegas, Mr White became enamoured with mixed martial arts some 30 years ago. At the time the multi-discipline sport was being banned in many American states and banished from big arenas. By the late 1990s some fights were held in the car parks of third-rate gambling parlours in places like Mississippi. Mr White spied an opportunity and in 2001 persuaded Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta, childhood friends who ran a successful casino business, to help him buy the struggling <small>UFC</small> for $2m.</p><p>At first red ink flowed as profusely as blood from fighters&#8217; noses. But the trio stanched the losses, cleaned up the sport and gradually won over mainstream audiences. In 2016 they sold it for around $4bn to a consortium led by Endeavor, a talent and sports-marketing powerhouse. Even adding the $50m or so that the Fertittas chipped in to cover initial losses and to bankroll &#8220;The Ultimate Fighter&#8221;, a reality-<small>TV</small> show now in its 32nd season which helped humanise what critics had disparaged as &#8220;human cockfighting&#8221;, this translates to an average compound annual return of over 40%. Not quite what Mr Zuckerberg made Facebook&#8217;s early backers, but tidy by most other measures.</p><p>In 2023 Endeavor and <small>WWE</small>, a pantomime wrestling franchise now streaming on Netflix, combined their assets into a publicly traded company, <small>TKO</small> Group. Since then the <small>UFC</small> has earned its listed parent $1.3bn in revenue and $770m in gross operating profit and helped nearly double its market value to $24bn over the past year. Some 700m people in 170 countries are fans. They are young, mostly male, with a median age in America of 37, compared with 39 for the <small>NBA</small> (basketball), 41 for <small>NASCAR</small> (motor racing) and 46 for the <small>NFL</small> (American football). Nearly half are aged 18 to 34, the knock-out demographic group for advertisers.</p><p>Analysts expect an almighty bidding brawl when the <small>UFC</small>&#8217;s broadcasting rights come up for renewal in the next few months. With no other big rights up for sale until 2028, these could fetch more than $1bn a year, double its current deal with Disney&#8217;s <small>ESPN</small> sports network. Sales of tickets to live fights and money from sponsorship deals, including with Monster Energy drinks, Bud Light beer and Timex watches, are up.</p><p>The <small>UFC</small> might not be where it is without Mr White. He is no teddy bear. Last year <small>TKO</small> reached a $375m settlement with ex-fighters alleging the <small>UFC</small> suppressed their pay. In 2022 a video surfaced of him slapping his wife. His mother has called him a &#8220;tyrant&#8221;. But as a businessman, he displays two important talents.</p><p>The first is his ability to spot trends. He filled a gap in the market for controlled aggression left by a disarray in the world of boxing. The <small>UFC</small> has fewer rules but more sway than that more genteel sport&#8217;s disparate federations. It is commissioner, owner and promoter all in one, says Mark Shapiro, <small>TKO</small>&#8217;s president. Mr White was also early to grasp the power of reality-<small>TV</small> and social media to paint fuller pictures of the fighters outside the ring, and of streaming to bring it all to audiences. This, plus clever match-ups, makes him &#8220;a mastermind of unscripted drama&#8221;, says Gareth Balch of Two Circles, a sports-marketing agency. Ampere Analysis, a research firm, reckons 61% of <small>UFC</small> fans would pay to watch it, better than <small>NASCAR</small> (44%) and not far off the <small>NFL</small> (65%) <small>.</small></p><h3>A White knuckle ride</h3><p class="end has-stop">Mr White&#8217;s other trait is pragmatism. Despite his ties to Mr Trump and the <small>UFC</small>&#8217;s association with a right-wing bro culture, he is no <small>MAGA</small> warrior. In 2016 he helped persuade Democratic state lawmakers and the governor in New York to legalise the <small>UFC</small> there. He rubs along with Ari Emanuel, <small>CEO</small> of <small>TKO</small> Group and brother of Barack Obama&#8217;s White House chief of staff. After the American right boycotted Bud Light over an ad featuring a transgender influencer in 2023, while Mr White was cutting a deal with its owner, <small>AB</small> InBev, he successfully pressed Mr Trump and his acolytes to uncancel the brand. As one of the world&#8217;s top ad men, Mr Zuckerberg would recognise this as a marketing coup for the annals. </p>
