          <h3>Hands off Greenland</h3><p>Greenland has long sought independence from Denmark and the idea that America could simply take over Denmark&#8217;s role as security guarantor and financial patron is deeply misguided (Free exchange, January 11th). It is not acceptable for one country to bully others. It took us two world wars to conclude that territorial sovereignty is the fundamental right of all countries. Denmark and Greenland would have no problem with an increased American commercial or military presence on the island. There are indeed legitimate strategic concerns, such as the ability of Russian aircraft or submarines to cross over or under the ice-shelf undetected, but these should not undermine the principles upon which international peace and prosperity are built.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>EMIL TAO BJORN</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Aarhus, Denmark</i></div></div><p>Donald Trump says he wants to gain Greenland to bolster the security of the United States, so focusing on the commercial value of the island is off the mark. This is not a commercial transaction, but an existential strategy, so the value of Greenland should not be based on its resources, but on those of the United States. That&#8217;s not easy to calculate, but one estimate puts the net wealth of the <small>US</small> at around $137trn. And since that takes no account of human happiness and welfare, isn&#8217;t that the absolute minimum-starting point from which to consider the proportion that is worth paying as insurance?</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>BILL YOUNG</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Arlesheim, Switzerland</i></div></div><p>Greenland could join Canada instead. As a new Canadian province or territory, Greenlanders would keep a large part of their autonomy, a universal health-care system and better social security. They would probably prefer Canada&#8217;s multiculturalism and First Nations rights to the United States&#8217; melting pot and disregard for anything un-American. Canada is also much closer geographically to Greenland, making travel, trading and services less expensive. Canada has unmatched mining expertise in the frozen north and good laws to protect the environment.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>ANDRÃ© MOREAU</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville, Canada</i></div></div><p>Regarding Mr Trump&#8217;s goading about Canada becoming America&#8217;s 51st state (Charlemagne, January 4th) perhaps the Republican should be reminded that the <small>US</small> has tried to take over Canada before, in the War of 1812. As I recall, this did not turn out too well for America.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>DAVID BREWER</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Puslinch, Canada</i></div></div><p>Mr Trump gets the numbers wrong. Canada would not become the 51st state. Leaving aside its three territories, Canada consists of ten provinces, which would be new states 51 to 60. Adding ten states from our more liberal northern neighbour would result in the Democrats enjoying permanent control of the Senate, the House of Representatives and the electoral college. Well played, Mr Trump.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>GEORGE KOVAC</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Miami</i></div></div><h3>When your home is flooded</h3><p>You referred to a &#8220;state-backed scheme&#8221; in Britain that can soften the insurance blow for those at risk from flooding (&#8220;Wet, wet, wet&#8221;, January 4th). That scheme, Flood Re, is often not well known or understood. It is paid for by insurers, rather than the government. Only homes built before 2009 are eligible, to ensure that the scheme&#8217;s very existence does not incentivise inappropriate house building. The scheme will end in 2039, along with the subsidised insurance premiums that households benefit from. Some mortgages may well extend beyond that date. If homes do flood, households should tap Flood Re&#8217;s Build Back Better initiative to protect against future flooding with relatively cheap and simple resilience measures, such as airbrick covers and non-return valves.</p><p>For insurance to remain affordable to those at risk of flooding after 2039, the government must continue to invest in new flood defences as well as maintaining existing ones. One in four homes in England is at risk of flooding. Climate change and new house-building policies will increase that number. The rampant paving over of front gardens, often for charging electric vehicles, is also not helping.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>HARRIET BOUGHTON</small></div><div class="letter-info__title">General counsel</div><div class="letter-info__organisation">Flood Re</div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>London</i></div></div><h3>Golden oldies</h3><p>I strongly object to <i>The Economist</i> describing people over 55 as the new problem generation, concluding that we are &#8220;behaving badly&#8221; (&#8220;Ageing disgracefully,&#8221; January 4th). Having led our lives raising the next generation, we deserve some self-determination when it comes to our personal use of alcohol, drugs and rock and roll as we grow older. We don&#8217;t need to hear the same demeaning judgments we heard when we were young, only this time from the younger generation.</p><p><i>The Economist</i> needs to instil in its younger writers the liberal set of values that it has always been known for.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>STEN LINNANDER</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Konstanz, Germany</i></div></div><p>Problematic cohorts of people now aged over 55 learned to be antisocial as teens in the 1980s, when committing crimes like joyriding and burglary was easy. It turns out that the likelihood of antisocial behaviour across the course of a life is determined not by when people are born, as often thought, but by how easy crime is to commit when they are adolescents. Put another way, opportunity makes the thief but also the persistently antisocial. This is why, despite close to 90% declines in many property and violent crimes since the early 1990s, these ageing cohorts remain troublesome.</p><p>Adolescent cohorts nowadays are marked by mostly low-crime-involvement. However, we should be wary of the potential longer-term effects of current easy crime opportunities, particularly those facilitated by the internet, such as fraud, online harassment and other victimisation, and by online marketplaces that make it easy to fence stolen goods. Phone theft also remains easy. Recent spikes in car theft in America, where electronic immobilisers are not mandated, could have longer-term cohort effects. All this means that reducing the opportunities for crime should be the platform on which crime-prevention policies are built.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>GRAHAM FARRELL</small></div><div class="letter-info__title">Professor of crime science</div><div class="letter-info__organisation">University of Leeds</div></div><h3>Amusing amphibians</h3><p>&#8220;The tadpole that conquered the world&#8221; (December 21st) reported on how the axolotl has become a global megastar, with its image plastered all over social media, toys and jewellery. The creature made its literary debut in 1956, in Julio CortÃ¡zar&#8217;s haunting short story &#8220;Axolotl&#8221;, where it is used as a profound metaphor for alienation and transformation. Arguably, CortÃ¡zar&#8217;s work played a role in embedding the axolotl in the global imagination long before its resurgence as a cultural and ecological icon.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>PIOTR ZIENTARA</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Gdynia, Poland</i></div></div><p>One of the axolotl&#8217;s most famous pop-culture appearances was in <i>Mad</i> magazine in 1958. It featured in a poem that began thus (apologies to Wordsworth): I wandered lonely as a clod/Just picking up old rags and bottles/When onward on my way I plod, I saw a host of axolotls/Beside the lake, beneath the trees/A sight to make a man&#8217;s blood freeze.</p><p>Truly a classic.</p><div class="letter-info has-stop"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>NELSON SMITH</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Toronto</i></div></div>
