        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">T</span><small>HE MAN</small> who sat facing Peter Fenwick in his consulting room was lucky to be alive. A while ago, he had come into St Thomas&#8217; hospital in London to have a catheter inserted in his heart. But things had gone wrong, and he went into cardiac arrest. There was no respiratory effort and no brain-stem reflex. For some minutes, to all the doctors round him, he was clinically dead.</p><p>But not to him. From somewhere outside his body he watched what they were doing to him, as he lay inert on the gurney. Then he went through a tunnel, towards a light that was strangely welcoming. At the tunnel&#8217;s end, bathed in that light, was a garden of beautiful flowers. He wandered there for a while, surrounded by love. He met dead relatives and silently conversed with them. Briefly he saw his life in review, though no one judged him except himself. Then he suddenly realised that if he went on, he would die. So he returned to his body and its pain.</p><p>Dr Fenwick was shocked to hear this, from a patient he thought he knew. He had heard about near-death experiences (<small>NDE</small>s), of course; he had read Raymond Moody&#8217;s &#8220;Life After Life&#8221;, published the year before, which had set up quite a stir. His verdict was that the book was absolute rubbish, flaky Californian stuff. But perhaps there was something here to look into.</p><p>It touched on the subject that had fascinated him ever since his graduation from Cambridge. What was consciousness, and how did it relate to brain function? Was it transcendent reality (as he increasingly felt), or was it secreted by the brain like bile from the liver? And what sort of research could bridge the gap? When he went into medicine his first interest was brain surgery, but he decided he didn&#8217;t want to look into the brain through some deep, dark hole; he needed to study its workings in conscious patients. The neurophysiology unit he ran for 20 years at the Maudsley Hospital dealt with epilepsy, sleep, meditation and dreams. <small>NDE</small>s were a natural next step.</p><p>Almost no work had been done on them. The field was clear; it was also dismissed. The world according to science in the 1960s was mechanistic and purely material. At Cambridge he hardly ever heard the word &#8220;consciousness&#8221;. <small>NDE</small>s were dismissed as hallucinations, or the result of drugs, anesthesia or oxygen deprivation; at worst, they were a sort of common myth for people afraid of death. At Cambridge the master of his college, Trinity, had won a Nobel prize partly for showing how neurons communicated with each other by pulses of electricity. Once neurons were completely understood, one critic told him, the debate would be over.</p><p>He had chosen a hard road. His attempt to set up a study of <small>NDE</small>s at the Maudsley was laughed away by its ethics committee. The head of the intensive-care unit said such things never happened there. A vicar, horrified, said no-one in his congregation had ever experienced such a thing. But all were proved wrong; for in 1988 a <small>BBC</small> documentary featuring Dr Fenwick brought in more than 2,000 letters from the Great British Public, who not only cheered him with stories of their own <small>NDE</small>s but, when he sent 500 of them detailed questionnaires, also gave him a wonderful database for a study of the phenomenon itself.</p><p>About 98% of the respondents had not known what an <small>NDE</small> was. Almost all, however, told much the same tale. They had left the body or gone down a tunnel towards a bright light, which embraced them with love and peace. At the end was a pastoral landscape or an English country garden, both a paradise. About 40% met dead relatives or friends there, but as presences rather than forms, and these often told them that it was not yet their time. Some had a life review, from which they were gently encouraged to learn. Then, when they reached a boundary they strongly felt they should not cross, they turned back. It was always their decision: something urgent had to be said, or done, before they actually died. One woman said she had to finish a pile of ironing. The similarity of these experiences, and their overwhelming realness for those who had them, fortified his own growing belief in a consciousness that was universal, external and contained many levels of reality: a consciousness that was only dimly filtered by the senses and the ever-busy, marvellous brain.</p><p>He was most intrigued, though, by what happened at deaths from which people did not return. When the brain died, did consciousness truly survive? He was debarred from questioning the dying, so he talked to relatives and carers in hospices. Attitudes varied widely: the doctors sceptical, some hostile, but nurses more open-minded. They heard patients describe deathbed visions and strange visitors, and at times met them too. They watched birds perch near the window, and a strong spiritual light filling the room. Far-off relatives described visits by the dead at the moment they died, always with the simple message: &#8220;I&#8217;m <small>OK</small>&#8221;.</p><p>The hardest part of death, as he reported in &#8220;The Art of Dying&#8221;, was to give everything up. The ego, so carefully constructed since childhood, so loud with chatter and insistent on control, had to be stripped away completely to achieve transcendence. While in this world, he had made a start. He studied Zen, which he found hard, and did daily meditation. He also followed the teachings of Alain Forget, a philosopher whose system for losing the ego was distancing and discernment. He discovered half-hidden walls in himself he had to break down, especially his resentment of his mother for sending him from Kenya, at the age of five, to boarding school in England. With a bit of a struggle, he learned to live in the moment, discarding both future and past.</p><p class="end has-stop">In his many talks, he never hectored like a preacher. He spoke calmly and happily, sometimes with his Burmese cat on his lap. His field of interest, controversial as it remained, filled him with joy and curiosity. Whatever was to come next, beyond the body, he knew it would be wonderful. He could hardly wait. </p>
