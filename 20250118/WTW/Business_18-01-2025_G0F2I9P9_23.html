          <figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250118_WWC426.png"></div></figure><p>The annual rate of <b>inflation</b> in America rose again in December, to 2.9%, the third consecutive increase. Although there was some relief that the core rate softened, markets expect the Federal Reserve to now slow its pace of interest-rate cuts. Economists warn that inflation will only strengthen if the new Trump administration imposes a harsh tariff regime. The sell-off eased in <b>bond markets</b>, but yields remain high, adding to governments&#8217; debt load, especially in Britain, where higher yields have upended the government&#8217;s fiscal plans. Investors in Britain found some relief when inflation there unexpectedly slowed in December, to 2.5%,</p><p><b>Argentina&#8217;s</b> annual inflation rate eased again in December to 117.8%. The peak last year was 289% in April. The month-on-month rate in December rose slightly to 2.7%; in December 2023 it stood at 25.5%.</p><p>The <b>German economy</b> shrank by 0.2% in 2024, after contracting by 0.3% in 2023. Output from construction was down by 3.8% and from manufacturing by 3%, in part because of the problems that Chinese competition and the transition to electric vehicles are causing Germany&#8217;s car industry. <b>Volkswagen&#8217;s</b> global sales fell by 2.3% in 2024. In China <small>VW&#8217;</small>s sales plunged by 10%.</p><p><b>Oil prices</b> rose to their highest levels since August, because of the new sanctions America has imposed on Russia&#8217;s oil industry to try to curb its exports. Brent crude traded above $82 a barrel; at the start of the year it was around $75.</p><p>The resurgence of China&#8217;s exports last year helped push its annual <b>trade surplus</b> up by 21% to $992bn, a third of which was with the United States.</p><p>The Biden administration imposed further restrictions on exporting <b>artificial-intelligence chips</b>, including caps on exports of graphics processing units. Nvidia, the leading supplier of <small>GPU</small>s <small>,</small> criticised the new rules as a &#8220;regulatory morass, drafted in secret and without proper legislative review&#8221;, which would &#8220;undermine&#8221; America&#8217;s leadership in the technology. It also said that the first Trump administration laid the foundation for America&#8217;s success in <small>AI,</small> which is perhaps a plea for the incoming new government to scrap the restrictions.</p><h3>Let the good times roll</h3><p><b>JPMorgan Chase</b> reported a net profit of $14bn for the final quarter of 2024, a 50% increase from the same period in 2023. Profit at America&#8217;s biggest bank for the whole of 2024 came in at $58.5bn, a record for the firm. Jamie Dimon, the bank&#8217;s chief executive, said businesses were &#8220;encouraged by expectations for a more pro-growth agenda&#8221;. <b>Goldman Sachs</b> doubled its profit in the fourth quarter, to $4.1bn. BlackRock, Citigroup and Wells Fargo also posted bumper earnings.</p><p>Qantas, Australia&#8217;s national airline, confirmed that it has had to delay flights between Sydney and South Africa because of the danger from <b> SpaceX rockets</b> returning to Earth over the Indian Ocean. The delays were caused by late changes by SpaceX to both the timing of the rockets&#8217; re-entries and location co-ordinates.</p><p><b>Johnson &amp; Johnson</b> agreed to buy <b>Intra-Cellular Therapies</b> for $14.6bn. Intra-Cellular specialises in the growing field of neuroscience, developing treatments for Parkinson&#8217;s disease and anxiety and depressive disorders.</p><p>Barrick Gold, a Canadian mining company, suspended operations at a gold mine in <b>Mali</b>, after the government confiscated gold stocks from the complex and placed them in a bank. A Malian judge ordered the seizure, reportedly claiming Barrick owed the government $5.5bn. Barrick is disputing the size of the state&#8217;s share of its mining revenues.</p><p>Meta joined a growing list of American companies that are ending or scaling back their <b>diversity, equity and inclusion</b> policies. The social-media company said the legal and policy landscape was changing, noting a shift in the Supreme Court&#8217;s position. <small>DEI</small> had also become a &#8220;charged&#8221; term, it said, coming to mean preferential treatment for some groups over others. Banging a final nail into the <small>DEI</small> coffin at Meta, Mark Zuckerberg ordered tampons to be removed from men&#8217;s bathrooms. He also mused about a &#8220;culturally neutered&#8221; corporate culture and the need for more &#8220;masculine energy&#8221;.</p><h3>Closing the open-door policy</h3><p class="has-stop">In another retreat from an inclusive policy, <b>Starbucks</b> issued a code of conduct for its coffeehouses, ditching a guideline that had allowed anyone to use the premises or toilets without buying anything. The restrooms are now for use by customers only, the company warned, and no violence, vaping, drugs or panhandling are allowed. In 2022 Starbucks closed 16 stores in urban areas because of &#8220;challenging incidents&#8221; that threatened people&#8217;s safety.</p>
