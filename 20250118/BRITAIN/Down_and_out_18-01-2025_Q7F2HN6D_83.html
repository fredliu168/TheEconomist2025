        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">A</span><small>ARON IS HAVING</small> a bad day. It is 7pm in Manchester city centre, and the temperature is just above freezing. The 34-year-old&#8217;s decaying teeth and soiled fingers are signs of his sleeping rough &#8220;on and off&#8221; for three years. He is begging for £17 ($21) for a hostel for the night. He is one of some 9,000 people in England likely to go without much shelter this winter.</p><p>Rough sleeping is only the most visible part of England&#8217;s growing homelessness problem. Add the many more placed by local authorities in temporary accommodation, and in all 354,000 people in England have no home (responsibility for housing is devolved). In the past five years their number has risen by 26%, according to data from Shelter, a charity.</p><p>The Labour government has set a lofty goal of &#8220;ending homelessness for good&#8221;. In December it increased local-government funding to tackle it during the coming fiscal year by 28%. Greater Manchester is a useful case study, because Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor since 2017, has made reducing homelessness a central aim.</p><figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250118_BRC351.png"></div></figure><p>He can point to some progress. In the 12 months to October the number of rough sleepers in Greater Manchester&#8217;s ten boroughs fell by 24%, from 148 to 112. (In London the figure rose by 34% over a similar period.) Paul Dennett, the mayor of Salford and Greater Manchester&#8217;s homelessness tsar, attributes the success to the city&#8217;s &#8220;a bed for every night&#8221; initiative. Each night, this makes available 550 beds for people who would otherwise sleep rough, at a cost of about £5.5m a year. Some £2m comes from the local National Health Service board, as the beds help keep the homeless out of hospital.</p><p>Immigration, especially via the asylum system, complicates the task. Anul, a 29-year-old Sudanese man sleeping in a tent outside Manchester&#8217;s neo-gothic city hall, says he was recently granted asylum 18 months after arriving in Britain. But in December he was evicted from accommodation paid for by the Home Office at 28 days&#8217; notice. In the past year some 3,500 people have ended up sleeping rough after leaving such digs; single men such as Anul fall well down the priority lists for housing. In Greater Manchester Mr Dennett repurposed a community centre to help alleviate the problem, putting in 40 blow-up beds.</p><p>The Home Office has extended its eviction-notice period from 28 to 56 days, on a pilot basis until June. That aligns it with legislation obliging local authorities to provide shelter to people facing homelessness within eight weeks. But as the Home Office has sped up the asylum process in order to reduce its own accommodation costs, it has strained local authorities&#8217; resources. Over the past year councils have assisted 22,000 recent asylum-seekers who had left Home Office accommodation.</p><p>The biggest difficulty is the precarious state of the broader housing market. In June 123,000 families in England were living in temporary accommodation&#8212;such as <small>B</small>&amp;<small>B</small>s and hotels&#8212;a rise of 43% in five years. That increase largely reflects people leaving privately rented homes at the end of their tenancies. The government has promised to increase protections for tenants, but it cannot prevent landlords from selling up, as many have. Last year Manchester created a &#8220;Good Landlord Charter&#8221; that it hopes will reduce evictions.</p><p>Finding permanent housing can be daunting. Bobby, a 50-year-old former construction worker, used to live with his mother in a housing-association bungalow. Six months ago, after her death, he was evicted; he now lives on the street. The benefits he receives will not pay for a home (people like him are in competition with young professionals for private rentals). Bobby hopes the local authority will find him one. But 90,000 families are on the waiting list for social housing in Greater Manchester; and 1.3m across England.</p><p>The most effective long-term way to reduce homelessness is to lower the cost of housing by building more homes. Mr Burnham has promised to build 10,000 &#8220;truly affordable&#8221; social homes by 2028. The government wants 1.5m new homes of all tenures to be built during this parliament.</p><p class="end has-stop">Being down and out does not always mean being down. All the rough sleepers <i>The Economist</i> spoke to in Manchester were remarkably optimistic. Yet Deborah Garvie of Shelter says the doors to decent housing &#8220;are firmly shut&#8221; for many. It will take years to open them. </p>
