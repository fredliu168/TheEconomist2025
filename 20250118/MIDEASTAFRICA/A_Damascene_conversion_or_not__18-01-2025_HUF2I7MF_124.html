        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">T</span><small>HE NEW</small> commander of the old city of Damascus was miffed. Syria&#8217;s new de facto leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, had just reversed his order to take over a grand old Ottoman palace. The arthouse within it had been used for &#8220;improper behaviour&#8221;, the commander insisted. Its resident female artists would sinfully come and go at all hours of the night, so he had posted two armed jihadists to make them remove their books, sketches and sound system by New Year&#8217;s Eve&#8212;and then get out.</p><p>Had the intervention been an exception, the commander might have stomached it. But since he and his fellow jihadists advanced from Idlib, their northern enclave, and toppled the Assads on December 8th, such rulings by Mr Sharaa have come thick and fast. He ordered the commander to leave crosses on top of churches, to protect the Christmas decorations of Christians and to respect the shrines of Shia Muslims (or &#8220;rejectionists&#8221;, as the Sunni jihadists call them). Mr Sharaa even told them to leave alone the bars where tipsy men and women were dancing together to ring in the new year. In Idlib those committing such depravity would have been killed, converted or expelled.</p><p>Frustration with Mr Sharaa is mounting among the Sunni fighters who toppled the Assad regime. Zealots among them, like the commander, worry he is ditching the jihadist faith he championed for 20 years. His supporters in the countryside, which was his heartland, fear they will be forgotten. Veterans who risked their lives, homes and jobs to join the rebellion worry that they have empowered another despot. The country has many discontents. But &#8220;the Sunni veterans could be the biggest faultline in the new Syria,&#8221; says Malik al-Abdeh, a Syrian analyst in Damascus with ties to the new order.</p><p>Religion is perhaps Mr Sharaa&#8217;s biggest challenge. In the past decade a new generation who fled to the hills have been brought up as Salafists, puritans who seek to replicate the mores of the Prophet Muhammad. Today&#8217;s jihadists are taking over mosques and spreading their bile from the pulpit. At least one moderate Sunni cleric has been killed since Mr Assad&#8217;s fall. At a recent Friday service in a mosque in an upmarket part of Damascus, the ambassadors of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (<small>UAE</small>) were shocked to hear a preacher castigate their rulers and warn that their fate would be the same as the Assads&#8217;. Women are worried, too. Notices have appeared on lampposts ordering them to wear the veil. The new justice minister has talked of imposing Islamic law. Female judges fear losing their jobs.</p><p>Moderate Syrians fear a new autocracy may be emerging. &#8220;He who liberates, decides,&#8221; say Mr Sharaa&#8217;s men. But many who suffered under Mr Assad are loth to see Mr Sharaa hijack their cause.</p><h3>Tugged to and fro</h3><p>Mr Sharaa found controlling his men hard enough in Idlib. For months before the breakout from that enclave, they marched through the streets chanting against Mr Sharaa&#8217;s despotism, calling for him to step down. His group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (<small>HTS</small>), of which the aggrieved commander in Damascus is a member, has a reputation for discipline. It is thought to have between 13,000 and 35,000 men. But it is thinly spread across a country that Mr Assad failed to control with a much bigger army.</p><p>Mr Sharaa relies on the same hotchpotch of rebel militias who may yet challenge his hold. Some 50,000 militiamen control the borderlands east of Idlib. Their commanders are likely to do what Turkey, their paymaster and Mr Sharaa&#8217;s chief ally, tells them. They have tentatively agreed to hand over their heavy weapons in return for posts in Mr Sharaa&#8217;s new army. But some prefer the profits they make from smuggling to slimmer salaries under the fragile and cash-strapped new regime.</p><p>The southern Sunni factions who beat Mr Sharaa&#8217;s northern alliance in the race to the capital are another force unto themselves. Their commander, Ahmed al-Awdeh, is still paying salaries to his 15,000 fighters, but says he is open to joining Mr Sharaa&#8217;s army, as long as his men keep their weapons and retain control of their turf. Mr Sharaa has also turned for help to a bunch of foreign fighters who have come down from the north. Hostile pockets of Islamic State, even more extreme jihadists, pepper Syria&#8217;s east.</p><p>The jihadists&#8217; frustrations are finding an outlet in attacks on the Alawite sect that propped up the Assads. In Homs, a largely Sunni city where Mr Assad resettled Alawites en masse, Sunnis from the north are forcibly reclaiming their homes. Sunni preachers are reported to have marched through nearby villages demanding that <i>kuffar</i>, or unbelievers, convert to Islam. Unverified footage shows them shooting captured army officers, leaving them handcuffed by the roadside. &#8220;When we hand over our weapons, they kill us,&#8221; says an Alawite who had been trying to make a deal.</p><p>Still, Mr Sharaa is a master of Sunni politics. In Idlib he both wooed and eliminated his foes. To keep rivals close, he has given a handful of foreign jihadists senior posts and appointed a justice minister who, while serving as a judge in Idlib, had a prostitute shot dead. At the same time, he has named his chief enforcer in Idlib, Anas Khattab, as his intelligence chief.</p><p class="end has-stop">Idlib is no blueprint for a modern state, so Syrians hope that tolerance may prevail. Bars remain open. Waitresses in the capital&#8217;s smartest hotel, where Mr Sharaa hosts foreign dignitaries, have yet to wear veils, though alcohol is no longer available. An art show at the national museum is set to reopen, nudes included. Marwan Tayyar, the director of the disputed arthouse, is still confident the city&#8217;s old ways will seduce its new arrivals. &#8220;You can conquer Damascus, but you can&#8217;t beat it.&#8221; </p>
