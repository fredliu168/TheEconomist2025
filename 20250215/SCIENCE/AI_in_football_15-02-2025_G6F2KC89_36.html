For an artificial-intelligence (<small>AI</small>) model, however, understanding what is going on is far from trivial. Raw video is stuffed with information, most of it irrelevant. The first thing an <small>AI</small> engineer, therefore, has to do is teach the model what matters and what doesn&#8217;t. For football tactics, player and ball positions are a good place to start. But a team isn&#8217;t just a collection of isolated players; it is a network of relationships.</p><p>Such networks, known to mathematicians as graphs, are made up of nodes connected by edges. On a football pitch, each player is a distinctive node, with edges capturing interactions such as passes and tackles. A match can, thus, be represented as an evolving sequence of graphs, no two alike between kickoff and the final whistle.</p><p><small>AI</small> models capable of parsing such information, known as graph neural networks (<small>GNN</small>s), can be used to identify which sorts of patterns spell danger for a team, and, consequently, what to avoid. Many scientific fields find them useful. At an upcoming conference hosted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Joris Bekkers and Amod Sahasrabudhe, two sports analysts, will present a model they devised while at the United States Soccer Federation. This predicts counterattacks using a method originally devised to predict how atoms come together to form crystals.</p><p class="end has-stop">All models are simplifications, and graph-based ones are no exception. For one thing, they are best at representing interactions between pairs of nodes. To capture a four-person defensive formation, other, yet more complex, structures may have to be called off the bench.</p>
