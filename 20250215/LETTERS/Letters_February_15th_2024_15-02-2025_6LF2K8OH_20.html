          <h3>Stocks and bonds</h3><p>Buttonwood&#8217;s column on February 1st argued that diversifying portfolios across asset classes has become harder in recent years. Fair enough. But there are two other points to consider. First, the stock and bond correlation is determined by the nature of the shocks hitting economies. The recent positive correlation may be temporary, driven by unprecedented large supply-side shocks, such as the European energy crisis and the supply-chain disruptions from the pandemic.</p><p>Modern monetary policy based on an inflation-targeting framework is supportive of a negative stock-bond correlation. We expect the negative correlation to return. The reason being that equity cashflows tend to be driven by economic growth. And in response to growth above trend, central banks tend to raise rates, leading to a positive correlation between growth and rates, and thereby a negative correlation between equities and bonds.</p><p>The second point is that correlation, although important, is not everything. Investors also care about the protection that bonds offer in equity downturns. For instance, during the global financial crisis of 2007-09, global equities fell by over 50% and global bonds rose by 6%. Bonds tend to act as shock absorbers when you need them the most. Average correlation does not capture this feature.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>GIULIO RENZI RICCI</small></div><div class="letter-info__title">Head of asset allocation</div><div class="letter-info__organisation">Vanguard Europe</div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>London</i></div></div><h3>Read all about it</h3><p>Historians do indeed love the <i>London Gazette</i>, Britain&#8217;s oldest newspaper (&#8220;Published by Authority&#8221;, February 1st). But it is far more than just &#8220;a treasure trove of trivia&#8221;. Its advertisements and notices are vital evidence of the social and economic history of Britain from 1665. Unfortunately, its search function is woefully inadequate, based on an Optical Character Reader from the dark ages of digital scanning, which scrambles letters, and leaves sizeable gaps in its publication years without scanning at all. To be properly appreciated and used systematically it needs to be re-digitised in full to current standards.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>JONATHAN BARRY</small></div><div class="letter-info__organisation">Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich</div></div><h3>Pay before you leave</h3><p>You argued that exit taxes, which, broadly, are paid when someone moves money out of a country, are dysfunctional (&#8220;In search of growth&#8221;, January 25th). Although it is true that exit taxes do not raise much revenue, they can protect the capital-gains tax base. Without exit taxation, countries run the risk that paying capital-gains taxes becomes a voluntary act of the less mobile, while the wealthy mobile escape by planning to emigrate.</p><p>To support the principle of capital-gains taxation on realisation rather than on accrual, a compromise must be made when individuals emigrate. A stricter exit-tax regime imposes a burden on illiquid entrepreneurs, whereas a laxer regime risks avoidance of taxation. Well-designed exit taxation of gains accrued while living in the country can support the tax system and ensure that stayers and leavers are treated similarly.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>KRISTOFFER BERG</small></div><div class="letter-info__title">Lecturer and fellow</div><div class="letter-info__organisation">Trinity College, University of Cambridge</div></div><h3>Social-media effects</h3><p>I take issue with your review of Nicholas Carr&#8217;s latest critical book on technology (&#8220;The bloom is off the rose&#8221;, February 1st). You suggested that research and insights into how social media affect young people are not worth another weighty tome. Actually, we don&#8217;t have enough of these books. As a father of three teenagers I have seen how their use of social media changes them. Social media do provide opportunities, but teenagers&#8217; brains seem to be ill-equipped to cope with the fancy new features designed by the engineers and product managers employed by Snap, Meta and the rest. And it looks like it&#8217;s by design. Mr Carr&#8217;s book is welcome amid an unequal fight that is changing societies.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>EDOUARD CHABROL</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Luxembourg</i></div></div><h3>A global mess of red tape</h3><p>There was a contradiction in your issue of February 1st between the leader praising deregulation (&#8220;The revolt against regulation&#8221;) and the leader in favour of the global minimum corporate tax (&#8220;Tax harmonies&#8221;). The latter is the most demanding tax regulation the world has ever seen on such a scale.</p><p>Very few tax scholars or practitioners can master this massive set of extremely complicated rules in any detail. When they were adopted by the European Parliament there was scarcely any debate. That may partly be due to the fact that hardly any of the parliamentarians were willing to expose their uncertainty. African tax lawyers have said that the complexity of the new rules is simply beyond their tax administrations.</p><p>In Norway representatives of the tax authorities have, off the record, said that the potential tax revenues will never exceed the costs of implementing the rules. And that is not taking into account the compliance costs for corporate taxpayers.</p><p>America has not adopted the global minimum corporate tax. So this will be one more example of the European Union overregulating in spite of the clear advice in Mario Draghi&#8217;s report on <small>EU</small> competitiveness that productivity should be the priority.</p><p>There is one clear winner from the global minimum tax: the big accounting firms. In total they are set to make literally hundreds of millions of dollars from assisting the taxpayers. But that is not an argument in favour of the tax, clearly the opposite.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>OLE GJEMS-ONSTAD</small></div><div class="letter-info__title">Professor emeritus of tax law</div><div class="letter-info__organisation">Norwegian Business School</div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Oslo</i></div></div><p>You praised Argentina&#8217;s deregulation efforts, and seemingly accepted the government&#8217;s view that all regulation stems from some form of government capture by private interests. By equating regulation with burdensome red tape, you overlooked its crucial role in addressing market failures. You gave an example of unnecessary costly &#8220;standards on the flammability of children&#8217;s pyjamas&#8221;. As a parent, I can easily imagine that if properly enforced, such standards would be a source of substantial consumer welfare.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>JAVIER ASENSIO</small></div><div class="letter-info__title">Associate professor</div><div class="letter-info__organisation">Department of Applied Economics, Autonomous University of Barcelona</div></div><p>I&#8217;m reminded of Bernard Woolley&#8217;s slogans to make people look kindly upon bureaucracy: &#8220;Administration saves the nation!&#8221;; &#8220;Red tape is fun!&#8221;; &#8220;Red tape holds the nation together!&#8221; Forty years on, &#8220;Yes Minister&#8221; remains as relevant as it ever was.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>VINCENT POIRIER</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Quebec City</i></div></div><h3>Selected ambient works</h3><p>Legion of followers of braindance may have spat out their cornflakes when they saw their strange but nonetheless very real music genre declared all but non-existent in the august pages of <i>The Economist</i> (&#8220;Don&#8217;t name that tune&#8221;, January 25th). Braindance does exist, sold perhaps millions of records, and was the odd brainchild of Aphex Twin&#8217;s Rephlex label, which even some of the once hip but now slightly less fleet-of-foot <small>CEO</small>s and business leaders who read your newspaper will surely remember.</p><div class="letter-info has-stop"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>ROBERT ROWLANDS</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Nottingham</i></div></div>
