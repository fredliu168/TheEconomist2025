        <section class="article__body">
          <figure class="media media--drawing media--wide"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250215_WBD000.png"></div></figure><p><span data-caps="initial">I</span><small>N THE BACK</small> of an unmarked office building close to <small>LAX</small>, the main airport of Los Angeles, stands a rack of unarmed hypersonic missiles the size of small drainpipes. On February 6th a camouflaged truck ferried one away to New Mexico for a test launch with the <small>US</small> Air Force. Such activity used to be common in El Segundo, the <small>LA</small> neighbourhood that was once a hub of military spaceflight. Then the cold war ended and with it much of the west-coast weapons business. Now it&#8217;s coming back. Castelion, which makes the projectiles, was founded in 2022 by three alumni of SpaceX, Elon Musk&#8217;s rocket-and-satellite company, which was also created in El Segundo.</p><p>Los Angeles is not alone in reviving the warrior spirit buried deep in its past. Silicon Valley is doing so, too. In its early days in the mid-20th century it created reconnaissance equipment for spy planes and semiconductors for missiles. But then the peaceniks took over and for decades defence became a dirty word. As recently as two years ago, Castelion couldn&#8217;t open a bank account in Silicon Valley owing to the stigma attached to making weapons.</p><p>Several developments have since stiffened the sinews. One is the war in Ukraine. Another is America&#8217;s deepening rivalry with China. Most alluring, perhaps, is the sweet smell of financial success. SpaceX has become the most valuable private firm in America, worth $350bn. Palantir, a supplier of software to Western armies and spooks, has a market value of more than $250bn, more than Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics, a trio of traditional defence contractors, combined. Anduril, a younger firm that makes autonomous weapons, is currently raising $2.5bn at a valuation of $28bn. Cue a cascade of investment into smaller startups making military kit for land, sea, air and space. PitchBook, a data gatherer, says the value of such deals in America rose by more than a third over the past two years, to almost $40bn. Venture funding as a whole fell over that period.</p><p>Less remarked upon is how the defence-tech boom challenges core tenets of the venture industry. Historically, venture investors shied away from supporting hardware industries, especially those like defence that can gobble up lots of capital. That is changing. So, too, is the worldview of many in Silicon Valley, who have turned their backs on the libertarian ethos that prevailed in recent decades in favour of a chest-thumping patriotism that celebrates American military might.</p><p>Silicon Valley&#8217;s renewed interest in military hardware reflects the shifting dynamics of combat on display in Ukraine: smaller weapons, notably drones, have supplemented and sometimes supplanted heavy armaments. That has left an opening for upstarts that can make cleverer or cheaper versions. Drones powered by whizzy artificial-intelligence systems are in vogue. So, too, is thriftiness. Take Castelion as an example. For its missile systems, it uses several automotive-grade chips, costing a few hundred dollars, rather than expensive space-grade ones. It manufactures rocket motors itself to keep costs down. SpaceX&#8217;s ability to shuttle satellites cheaply into low-Earth orbit, where they can scrutinise the planet, has made space an increasingly affordable part of battlefield technologies. Like many of the defence technologies supported by Silicon Valley, these also serve civilian uses, boosting their revenue potential.</p><p>A revival of the warrior spirit is transforming Silicon Valley&#8217;s relationship with America&#8217;s government, too. &#8220;The Technological Republic&#8221;, a forthcoming book co-authored by Alex Karp, Palantir&#8217;s chief executive, calls on Silicon Valley to work with Uncle Sam on military programmes. Rather than supporting environmental and social causes, those like Mr Karp champion patriotism as the new corporate purpose, an idea that will appeal to many in Donald Trump&#8217;s administration.</p><p>Meanwhile, the long-established revolving door between the Pentagon and the defence industry is being extended to venture capitalists and tech firms. That could help speed up the disruption to America&#8217;s military-industrial complex which many in defence tech hope for (see Briefing). &#8220;If the government doesn&#8217;t figure out how to make the venture model work, this will not be sustainable,&#8221; says Shyam Sankar of Palantir. One issue is the meagre share of spending that is available to startups. Another is the broad-brush approach the Pentagon takes towards them. Mr Sankar argues that the government needs to come to terms with Silicon Valley&#8217;s &#8220;power law&#8221;, in which a few big winners generate fortunes, compensating for the many others that fall by the wayside. The Pentagon also needs to transition away from &#8220;cost-plus&#8221; contracts, which are designed to enable big weapons programmes and guarantee incumbent contractors decades of revenue, in favour of &#8220;fixed-price&#8221; ones that outsiders can bid on.</p><h3>Out of the trenches</h3><p>In Silicon Valley the overriding question remains not victory or defeat, but exit: how can venture capitalists emerge from their investments with hypersonic returns? When it comes to defence tech, the usual route of an initial public offering does not look promising. Palantir is a rarity in the industry for braving the public markets. Though its stock has ballooned, it gets little love from Wall Street analysts, who say it is overvalued. The alternative is to sell to corporate buyers. Yet those with the deepest pockets are the traditional defence contractors. Some startups loathe the thought of suffocating in such a quasi-state-owned culture.</p><p class="end has-stop">There is a glimmer of hope, though. As well as seeding the entrepreneurs building the new ventures, Anduril, Palantir and SpaceX are now rich enough to make acquisitions. Part of the $2.5bn Anduril is raising is likely to be spent on buying new firms. Market forces are still the most reliable weapons of war. </p>
