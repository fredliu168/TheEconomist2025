          <p>Donald Trump held a phone call with Vladimir Putin and said he would &#8220;immediately&#8221; start negotiations to end <b>Russia&#8217;s war in Ukraine</b>, announcing that he and the Russian president would hold talks that will be hosted by Saudi Arabia. Their conversation lasted 90 minutes and was the highest level of contact between the Oval Office and the Kremlin since the start of the war in 2022. Mr Trump then called Volodymyr Zelensky to inform him about the conversation. The Ukrainian president said they had talked about a &#8220;lasting, reliable peace&#8221;. In an earlier interview with <i>The Economist</i> Mr Zelensky had warned about the dangers of excluding Ukraine from negotiations.</p><p>The newfound co-operation between America and Russia was also evident in a <b>prisoner swap</b>. Russia released Marc Fogel, an American teacher it has held in detention since 2021. America returned Alexander Vinnik, a cyber-criminal.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <small>UN</small> monitor in Ukraine reported that short-range <b>drones</b>, equipped with cameras and able to distinguish civilians from troops, had caused more civilian deaths in January than any other weapon.</p><p>Klaus Iohannis resigned as <b>Romania&#8217;s</b> president rather than face an impeachment vote in parliament. Mr Iohannis stayed in office after the result of November&#8217;s presidential election was voided by the courts amid claims of Russian meddling. The election was won by Calin Georgescu, a hard-right critic of <small>NATO.</small> The decision to scrap the result has infuriated the right-wing opposition. A re-run of the election will be held in May, though it is uncertain if Mr Georgescu will be allowed to run.</p><h3>Unplugged</h3><p>Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania disconnected themselves from Russia&#8217;s electricity grid and joined the European Union&#8217;s network in a two-day switchover. The <b>Baltic countries</b> have not bought electricity from Russia since 2022 but were still dependent on its grid for power flow. They joined the Russian grid in the 1950s when they were under the Soviet thumb.</p><p>The leaders of the main national-conservative parties in France, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain were among the participants at a <b>Make Europe Great Again</b> rally in Madrid, where they urged the <small>EU</small> to adopt some of the policies Donald Trump has introduced in America. &#8220;Yesterday we were the heretics, today we are the mainstream&#8221;, declared Viktor Orban, Hungary&#8217;s prime minister. None of them mentioned tariffs.</p><p>The ruling Vetevendosje social-democratic party won the most votes in an election in <b>Kosovo</b>, though it fell short of enough seats for an overall majority in parliament. The prime minister, Albin Kurti, has rejected forming a coalition with opposition parties, describing them as &#8220;animals&#8221; and &#8220;thieves&#8221;.</p><p>Talks led by the hard-right Freedom Party to form a government in <b> Austria</b> with the conservative People&#8217;s Party collapsed over differences on Russia and the <small>EU.</small> The Freedom Party wants a fresh election, hoping it may do even better than its showing at the polls in September.</p><p>In Britain the <small>MP</small> behind a controversial <b>assisted-dying bill</b> introduced an amendment that would remove the legislation&#8217;s judicial safeguard of requiring a high-court judge&#8217;s approval for individual cases. More than 140 <small>MP</small>s who previously voted for the bill at its second-reading stage because of that safeguard may now vote against it, according to reports. The bill passed its second reading last November with a majority of 55.</p><p>King Abdullah of <b>Jordan</b> visited the White House for talks with Donald Trump. The president reiterated his plan for America to take over <b>Gaza</b> and force the removal of more than 2m Palestinians who live there. He earlier suggested that he would stop aid to Jordan and <b>Egypt</b> if they did not allow Palestinians to settle in their countries. After the meeting King Abdullah reiterated his government&#8217;s &#8220;steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians&#8221;. At a meeting with Marco Rubio, America&#8217;s secretary of state, Badr Abdelatty, Egypt&#8217;s foreign minister, said Arab states rejected Mr Trump&#8217;s plan. Egypt is working on a plan of its own.</p><p>The <b>ceasefire</b> between Hamas and Israel in Gaza came under strain after the militant group said it would postpone the release of three hostages scheduled for February 15th. Hamas appeared to back down after Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel&#8217;s prime minister, said he would end the ceasefire if the hostages are not returned.</p><p>The <small>UN</small> said that a worker in its World Food Programme had died while he was being held in detention in <b>Yemen&#8217;s</b> Sa&#8217;ada region, and called on the Iranian-backed Houthis to release the couple of dozen <small>UN</small> staff that it is still holding.</p><p>Fighting erupted in eastern <b>Democratic Republic of Congo</b> despite calls from African leaders for a ceasefire between <small>M23,</small> a rebel group backed by Rwanda, and Congolese forces. Having captured Goma, <small>M23</small> is advancing towards Bukavu, another big city 200km (125 miles) away.</p><p><b>Ecuador&#8217;s</b> presidential election will go to a run-off in April, after the centre-right incumbent, Daniel Noboa, and his left-wing challenger, Luisa González, fell short of the 50% vote threshold to claim victory. It was thought that Mr Noboa&#8217;s record of cracking down on gang violence would be enough for him to win the first round, but Ms González, who served in the government of Rafael Correa, a former leftist president, has promised to boost the economy and cut fuel prices.</p><p>Sexual violence against children in <b>Haiti</b>, including rape, has increased by 1,000% since 2023, according to Unicef. Children as young as eight are also being forcibly recruited into the warlords&#8217; gangs that control much of the country, and now account for half of all gang members.</p><p>Narendra Modi, <b>India&#8217;s</b> prime minister, went to Washington for a meeting with Mr Trump. The leaders have a good relationship, forged over a shared interest in countering the rise of China, but they will also discuss trade and worker visas.</p><h3>Don&#8217;t be my Valentine</h3><figure class="media media--picture media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250215_WWP001.jpg"></div></figure><p class="has-stop">The number of marriages in <b>China</b> fell by 20% last year, according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, a bigger rate of decline than during the pandemic. Only 6.1m couples tied the knot, less than half the number who were wed a decade ago. The state is pressing colleges to hold &#8220;love education&#8221; seminars that emphasise the benefits of marriage and family as one way of increasing the country&#8217;s low birth rate.</p>
