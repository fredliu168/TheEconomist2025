        <section class="article__body">
          <p>Emmanuel Macron hosted a <b> summit on artificial intelligence</b> in Paris that was advertised as a chance to speed up the development of the technology, while ensuring that &#8220;nobody is left behind&#8221;. The French president announced private-sector investments and urged Europe to &#8220;resynchronise with the rest of the world&#8221; on <small>AI.</small> But America and Britain spoiled the party by not signing the official declaration, which mentioned international governance, and was signed by China. J.D. Vance, America&#8217;s vice-president, warned against &#8220;excessive regulation&#8221;, which could stifle innovation, and making deals with &#8220;authoritarian regimes&#8221;.</p><h3>Where does he find the time?</h3><p><b>Elon Musk</b> made an unsolicited $97bn bid to buy the non-profit group that controls Open<small>AI.</small> Mr Musk was one of the startup&#8217;s founders but has since had a spectacular falling out with Sam Altman, another founder and its current boss, and has launched his own rival <small>AI</small> firm. Mr Altman is trying to convert Open<small>AI</small> from a not-for-profit entity to a for-profit company. He rejected the bid, cheekily offering to buy X, Mr Musk&#8217;s social-media platform, for $9.74bn instead.</p><p><b>SoftBank</b> reported a quarterly loss of Â¥369bn ($2.4bn), in part because of a drop in the value of the tech investments held by its Vision Funds. The Japanese conglomerate plans to raise the money for its recently announced investment in a joint venture with Open<small>AI</small> on a project-by-project basis.</p><p>The <small>EU</small> said it would respond with &#8220;proportionate countermeasures&#8221; to Donald Trump&#8217;s proposal to impose 25% <b>tariffs</b> on all steel and aluminium imports to America. The <small>EU</small> is hoping for talks with the Americans before the duties come into force on March 12th. Meanwhile, China went ahead and imposed its counter-tariffs on American goods, after a deadline passed to reach a deal.</p><p><b>BP</b>&#8217;s annual underlying profit of $8.9bn in 2024 was its worst since 2020. Amid a chorus of criticism from investors, the oil giant promised to &#8220;fundamentally reset&#8221; its strategy. Its stock did jump earlier, however, in response to news that Elliott Management, an activist hedge fund known for shaking up management boards, has taken a stake in the company. <small>BP&#8217;</small>s market value is about half that of Shell&#8217;s.</p><p>Following a disappointing set of earnings for the fourth quarter, <b>Chevron</b> announced a cost-cutting strategy that could see it shed 20% of its workforce before the end of 2026.</p><p>The world&#8217;s biggest supplier of batteries for electric vehicles filed to sell shares in a secondary listing in Hong Kong, which is expected to be the city&#8217;s biggest stock offer since 2021. Based in China, <b>CATL</b> wants to raise funds for its international expansion plans.</p><p><b>Foxconn</b>, an electronics contract manufacturer that assembles the iPhone, confirmed that it was interested in buying Renault&#8217;s stake in <b>Nissan</b>, after merger talks between Nissan and Honda reportedly fell apart. Foxconn is interested in acquiring the stake only if the deal includes co-operation on <small>EV</small>s, which it is developing through its Foxtron venture.</p><p><b>Unilever</b> announced that it would list its ice-cream business on the Amsterdam stock exchange, with other listings in London and New York. It expects to spin off the business, which includes Ben &amp; Jerry&#8217;s, by the end of this year.</p><figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250215_WWC674.png"></div></figure><p>America&#8217;s annual rate of <b> inflation</b> rose for the fourth consecutive month in January. At 3%, it is back up to where it was last June, before the Federal Reserve embarked on a round of interest-rate cuts. In his first testimony to Congress since Mr Trump&#8217;s return to the White House, Jerome Powell, the Fed&#8217;s chairman, said he was in &#8220;no rush&#8221; to cut rates again.</p><p>The <b>British economy</b> grew by 0.1% in the last quarter of 2024 compared with the previous quarter. Markets had expected a contraction. For the year as a whole <small>GDP</small> expanded by 0.9%.</p><p>More firms abandoned their commitment to <b>diversity, equity and inclusion</b>. Disney ditched a <small>DEI</small> measure that contributed towards setting executive pay, replacing it with one on &#8220;talent strategy&#8221;. Goldman Sachs dropped a rule that stopped it from advising firms about listing shares if the boards of those firms were all male and white. And Deloitte <small>US</small> asked staff working on government contracts to delete gender pronouns in emails.</p><h3>The penny dropped</h3><p class="has-stop">Donald Trump ordered the Treasury to stop producing <b>one-penny coins</b> because they are literally a waste of money. Each penny costs 3.7 cents to make. Canada got there first, eliminating its penny in 2012. But Americans for Common Cents, a group that wants to keep the coin, say consumers will be short-changed as demand for nickels would rise, increasing costs to the taxpayer. A nickel is worth five cents but costs 13.8 cents to make.</p>
