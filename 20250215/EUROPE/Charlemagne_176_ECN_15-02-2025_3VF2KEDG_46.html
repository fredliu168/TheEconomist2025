          <figure class="media media--drawing media--wide"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250215_EUD000.png"></div></figure><p><span data-caps="initial">F</span><small>EELING A BIT</small> glum and in need of a reboot, plenty of middle-aged Europeans opt for a retreat in India, seeking the reinvigorating properties of a few yoga stretches and gallons of <i>masalachai</i>. Might the trick work for political federations as well? The entire team of 27 European Union commissioners is gearing up for a brief passage to India later this month, a rare mass excursion out of their small peninsula. For the Brussels-dwelling Eurocrats on tour, the bustling South Asian vibe on offer will mark a sharp contrast with their home turf, whose sclerotic economy is matched only by its gridlocked politics.</p><p>The visit will kick up lots of talk of a &#8220;strategic partnership&#8221; between the world&#8217;s two biggest democracies. There will be earnest entreaties to agree on a trade deal, 18 years after talks began. Some touring officials will no doubt grumble about the grinding poverty, or the putrid Delhi smog. Europeans have long come to poorer countries with lectures on how backward locals should aspire to be more like them, with a focus on human rights, green rules and so on. That moralising tone might usefully be left behind in this case. For all India&#8217;s flaws, an attentive European visitor will see much there that should make them envious&#8212;and that they might learn from. Once under the thumb of various European colonisers, India is an unexpected role model for today&#8217;s <small>EU</small>.</p><p>The most desirable feature the wandering Europeans will come across on their trip is economic growth, something that feels as alien in their homeland as bland food might in Mumbai. True, the Indian economy has cooled of late, generating a mere 5.4% year-on-year growth at last count. Still, that is roughly 5.4% more than the euro area. For India, growing at an annual average rate of around 7% over the past decade or so has yielded more than higher living standards. The confidence in a bigger, richer future provides a spring in the Indian stride and geopolitical swagger that Europeans can hardly remember. As a rich place, the <small>EU</small> will not soon experience growth at Indian rates, nor will India soon reach European living standards (it aims to be a developed nation by 2047). Still, there are lessons for the <small>EU</small> to draw. Narendra Modi, India&#8217;s prime minister since 2014, has sometimes been hesitant in his economic reforms. But the introduction of a pan-Indian Goods and Services Tax in 2017 removed internal economic borders between states to create a single market of the sort Europe harps on about endlessly, but fails to ensure works well.</p><p>Equally unattainable for Europe, but no less desirable, is its host&#8217;s demography. India overtook China to become the world&#8217;s most populous country in 2023&#8212;just as the <small>EU</small> population started shrinking for the first time since the Black Death in the 14th century. The median Indian, aged just 29, is in fine cricket-playing mettle. His European counterpart, in his mid-forties, needs a rest after softly kicking a football. India frets its &#8220;demographic dividend&#8221; may fizzle, and that it might get old before it gets rich. Europe, for its part, worries it will get poorer as it gets older, and its social-security system runs out of workers to pay for the swelling ranks of retirees. If ever there was a place for <small>EU</small> policymakers to ponder the sustainability of their social model, India is it.</p><p>As representatives of federal Europe&#8217;s top body, the commissioners will look with jealousy at India&#8217;s governance. Though the <small>EU</small> is a concatenation of 27 nations that gel into an awkward polity, India is the mirror image: one proud nation divided into 28 states. The <small>EU</small> is a bloc with a few trappings of a country, such as a common currency, flag and a national anthem (though no lyrics). But European citizens lack a visceral attachment to their union, preferring their countries (or even regions) instead. Some assume it will always be so. How can a peninsula with two dozen official languages, different religions and cuisines ever spawn a coherent collective identity, with an army to boot? Europe is wondering; India has already shown the way. Not every facet of Indian politics is worth replicating. But whereas India suffers from bouts of crass majoritarianism, it can be hard for Europe&#8217;s disparate coalition governments to come up with any sort of majority at all. India&#8217;s polity is sometimes over-centralised; the <small>EU</small>&#8217;s conversely can feel unworkable under the weight of vetoes wielded by national governments. Something for the Europeans to ponder over a biryani.</p><p>What of policies that Europe could emulate? India has pioneered digital public infrastructure that works. An &#8220;India Stack&#8221; of technology now links citizens&#8217; identity with their phones and bank accounts, making dealing with the still-hulking bureaucracy less daunting than it once was. Even more than Mr Modi, the Eurocrats should ask to meet Nandan Nilekani, an Indian tech grandee who pioneered the digital <small>ID</small> scheme, known as Aadhaar, and the whizzy services that go alongside it. A detour to Bangalore and its startup scene would prove enlightening for the <small>EU</small> brigade.</p><h3>Indian summer</h3><p class="end has-stop">Beyond the elusive trade deal, much of the talk will be about geopolitics. India and Europe are both aspiring third wheels in a <small>G</small>2 world. Both fret about being dependent on China as a trade partner (and could use each other&#8217;s help to diversify). Both also worry about America&#8217;s Trumpian turn, though it is more obviously problematic for the <small>EU</small>. Without the kind of outside security guarantor that has underpinned European security for decades, India has developed some measure of the &#8220;strategic autonomy&#8221; Europeans now crave. It has form when it comes to playing off potential partners against each other. Europeans winced when Mr Modi last year hugged Russia&#8217;s Vladimir Putin in Moscow (perhaps unsurprisingly given Russia is still its biggest supplier of arms) while also getting closer to America. That is the type of diplomatic contortion even a yogi would struggle to pull off. Europeans may not like it, but they should at least try to understand it. </p>
