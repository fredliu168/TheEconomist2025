          <p><span data-caps="initial">M</span><small>ANY ARGENTINES</small> sip <i>mate</i> daily. The brewed, bitter drink is made by infusing leaves of the <i>yerba mate</i> plant, a relative of holly. It is grown by some 13,000 farmers, mostly on a small scale across 230,000 hectares (568,000 acres), predominantly in the northern province of Misiones.</p><p>Argentina&#8217;s president, Javier Milei, deregulated the industry in December 2023, ending the power of the National Institute of Yerba Mate&#8217;s (<small>INYM</small>) to set minimum prices. Now growers are struggling. Prices for their crop have dropped by more than 50% in real terms. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t cover costs,&#8221; says María Ferreira, a <i>yerba mate</i> grower, sitting by a road in Misiones. She and other growers say they are now at the mercy of the ten mills that buy, grind and package more than 70% of the supply.</p><p>They have been here before. The industry was regulated for nearly 60 years until the then-president, Carlos Menem, dissolved the commission that set planting limits in 1991. Subsequent overproduction saw a steep decline in prices over the next decade. Farmers blocked roads with their tractors in protest and in 2002 regulation returned with the creation of the <small>INYM</small>.</p><p>The institute&#8217;s 12 directors, from different parts of the supply chain, set minimum prices through unanimous agreement. The federal government arbitrated disagreement. &#8220;Artificially high&#8221; prices resulted in over-planting, says Gerardo Alonso Schwarz, an economist in Misiones. In recent years the <small>INYM</small> began to limit how much could be planted. &#8220;The reality is that the regulatory entity that could have controlled the cycles didn&#8217;t do it,&#8221; he says.</p><p>Argentina&#8217;s deregulation ministry has applauded the reduced price that consumers are paying for their brew, which in November was 30% lower in real terms than a year earlier. Industry leaders attribute the 50% price reduction that some farmers have seen to an improved growing climate, and to the use of the black market. &#8220;Many producers don&#8217;t want to pay taxes, so they sell to other people who pay them less,&#8221; says Victoria Szychowski, who runs the Amanda <i>mate</i> brand.</p><p>María Soledad Fracalossi of the <small>INYM</small> has encouraged farmers to diversify their crops. Although a federal court has ordered the suspension of Mr Milei&#8217;s deregulation measures with respect to <i>yerba mate</i>, Ms Fracalossi says the <small>INYM</small> cannot set prices until all of its directors&#8217; seats are filled. The federal government appoints its president. It has not done so.</p><p class="end has-stop">Strikingly, even though growers are upset, many don&#8217;t harbour hard feelings towards Mr Milei; his budget cuts have helped the country reduce inflation dramatically. Jorge Lizznienz, a second-generation <i>yerba mate</i> farmer, says that the libertarian has given Argentines hope. When it comes to <i>yerba mate</i> though, he ventures that &#8220;the president of the country is being badly advised.&#8221; </p>
