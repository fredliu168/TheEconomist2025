        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">L</span><small>OCKDOWN HAS</small> a lot to answer for. As many were baking sourdough at home, Jacques Audiard, a French film-maker, was writing an opera libretto about a Mexican cartel boss who fakes his own death, undergoes gender-transition surgery and campaigns for the missing victims of the drug war. The resulting film, a trans-narco-musical fever dream called &#8220;Emilia Pérez&#8221;, has earned 13 Oscar nominations. Since the Academy Awards began in 1929, only three films have received more. No other foreign-language film ever has.</p><p>Hollywood is besotted, but audiences are not. Movie-goers&#8217; reviews have been savage. On the Internet Movie Database (<small>IMD</small>b) it is the lowest-rated Best Picture nominee since 1935, earning a six out of ten. On Rotten Tomatoes, which aggregates critic and audience opinions, the public approval rating is just 23%. The nine other Best Picture nominees score between 75% and 99%.</p><p>The film&#8217;s Rotten Tomatoes rating is down from 75% in December, before it opened in Mexico, where viewers were unimpressed (see chart). Some of this decline is explained by &#8220;review bombing&#8221;. This can happen when films take on heated subjects. &#8220;The Promise&#8221; (2016), about the Armenian genocide, saw its <small>IMD</small>b page mobbed with thousands of one-out-of-ten ratings from users in Turkey; in response, most Armenians gave it full marks, resulting in a middling overall score.</p><figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250201_CUC497.png"></div></figure><p>But socially conservative Mexicans objecting to a trans woman starring in a film is not the full picture. &#8220;Emilia Pérez&#8221; is, objectively, poor. The dialogue sounds as if it has been hastily translated from French to English to Spanish, leading to jarring phrases like, &#8220;<i>Hasta me duele la pinche vulva nada más de acordarme de ti&#8221;</i> (&#8220;Even my fucking vulva still hurts as soon as I think of you&#8221;). The lyrics have been lost in translation, too. Consider the opening line of one song: &#8220;Hello, very nice to meet you. I&#8217;d like to know about sex-change operations.&#8221; (Somehow &#8220;hello&#8221; gets one syllable and &#8220;change&#8221; gets two.) &#8220;I see, I see, I see,&#8221; is the reply, as perfunctory an iambic trimeter as you will ever hear.</p><p>Botched pronunciations have angered Mexicans. Karla Sofía Gascón, who plays Emilia, was born in Madrid and cannot always hide her Spanish accent. Emilia&#8217;s wife with the sore vulva (played by pop star Selena Gomez) sounds robotic in Spanish and slips into English halfway through a line. Adriana Paz, Emilia&#8217;s love interest, is the only Mexican in the main cast. She has less than 12 minutes of screen time.</p><p>Some also feel the film trivialises the drug war. They accuse it of focusing on one person&#8217;s story while ignoring how devastating the cartels continue to be; some 100,000 Mexicans have disappeared or are missing since record-keeping began. Even some trans people are critical. <small>GLAAD</small>, an <small>LGBT</small>+ advocacy group, has called the film a &#8220;profoundly retrograde portrayal of a trans woman&#8221;, relying on tired tropes.</p><p>Why, given the film&#8217;s flaws, does Hollywood celebrate it? Two factors are at work. One is money. Netflix, which bought the film for $12m, has reportedly invested tens of millions of dollars in its awards campaign. This is its tenth attempt at a Best Picture win since &#8220;Roma&#8221; became the first film on a streamer to be nominated in 2019. (Apple <small>TV</small>+ was the first streaming service to win the top prize with &#8220;CODA&#8221; in 2022.)</p><p class="end has-stop">The other explanation is Hollywood&#8217;s liberal self-image. Members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, who vote on Oscar winners, put a high premium on diversity. Both &#8220;Crash&#8221; (2004) and &#8220;Green Book&#8221; (2018) won Best Picture, despite what critics saw as mawkish takes on America&#8217;s race problems. The ostensibly inclusive credentials of &#8220;Emilia Pérez&#8221;, including a trans lead, probably contributed to its nomination haul. Hollywood&#8217;s top brass may want to send a message to Donald Trump and his socially conservative administration. But even Oscar wins are not going to be enough to persuade audiences to sing the film&#8217;s praises. </p>
