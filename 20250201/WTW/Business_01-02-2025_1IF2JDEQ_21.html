          <figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250201_WWC535.png"></div></figure><p>America&#8217;s tech companies clawed back some of the losses from the stockmarket rout that accompanied news that <b>DeepSeek</b>, a Chinese generative artificial-intelligence firm, was seeing the same results as models from Western rivals, but with a fraction of the computing power and thus at a much lower cost. DeepSeek&#8217;s chatbot surged to the top of Apple&#8217;s iPhone download charts. Its success overturns the idea that companies have to spend huge sums on <small>AI</small> to stay ahead, which has been powering the stockmarket enthusiasm for all things <small>AI-</small>related. American tech companies lost $1trn in value over a single day, led by Nvidia, which shed $589bn of its market capitalisation, or 17% of its share price.</p><h3>Adjusting profits</h3><p>Investors were left disappointed by <b>Microsoft&#8217;s</b> earnings, as revenue from its cloud business came in below expectations and it reported a big jump in capital spending. <b>Meta&#8217;s</b> results were more pleasing and Mark Zuckerberg promised to spend &#8220;hundreds of billions&#8221; on <small>AI.</small> Orders for <b>ASML&#8217;s</b> equipment for making high-end <small>AI</small> chips far exceeded expectations. The Dutch company&#8217;s share price rallied and its chief executive described the advent of DeepSeek as &#8220;good news&#8221; for the chip industry.</p><p><b>Tesla&#8217;s</b> fourth-quarter revenue and profit missed Wall Street estimates. Elon Musk promised that the carmaker&#8217;s investments in <small>AI</small> and robotics would bear fruit in 2025. Meanwhile, Tesla filed a lawsuit at the European Court of Justice over the <small>EU&#8217;</small>s extra tariffs on imports of electric vehicles from China, which were imposed last October. About a fifth of <small>EV</small>s sold in the <small>EU</small> are made in China.</p><p>Charges related to the write-down of its Chinese joint ventures and a restructuring charge in China dragged down <b>General Motors&#8217;</b> annual net profit, to $6bn. But the carmaker&#8217;s adjusted operating profit rose to $14.9bn, a record for the company.</p><p>Japan&#8217;s central bank lifted interest rates for the first time since July and the third time since ending its negative-rate policy last March. The <b>Bank of Japan</b> increased its main rate from 0.25% to 0.5%, the highest it has been since the global financial crisis, and revised up its inflation forecast. The bank&#8217;s governor, Ueda Kazuo, suggested that more interest-rate rises were on the way, without saying when.</p><p>The <b>Federal Reserve</b> kept its benchmark interest rate on hold at a range of between 4.25% and 4.5%. America&#8217;s annual inflation rate has been steadily rising since September and the jobs market remains strong, factors that make the Fed wary of cutting rates. The path ahead is complicated by the uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump&#8217;s policies: higher tariffs will only add to inflationary pressures. The president has made it clear that he wants interest rates to fall. After the Fed left rates unchanged he turned to social media to tear into its record.</p><p>A little under 4.1m previously owned houses were sold in America last year, according to the National Association of Realtors. With mortgage rates remaining high, it was the lowest number of existing-home sales since 1995. Underlining the increasing lack of accessibility to the <b>property market</b> for many Americans, the median existing-home price rose to a record $407,500 in 2024.</p><p><b>Boom Supersonic</b>, an American startup that is planning to build a faster-than-sound airliner, flew its one-third-scale demonstrator aircraft at Mach 1.1. It was the first non-military supersonic flight since Concorde was grounded in 2003.</p><p><b>Boeing&#8217;s</b> net loss in 2024 amounted to $11.8bn. The company had a horrendous year, which began with a panel falling off a <small>737 MAX</small> shortly after take-off. That led to investigations of Boeing&#8217;s production process, which curtailed its output. It also endured a six-week labour strike.</p><p>Rachel Reeves, <b>Britain&#8217;s</b> chancellor of the exchequer, outlined plans to boost economic growth, including investing in a research triangle linking London, Oxford and Cambridge. She also backed plans for a third runway at Heathrow airport, though planes won&#8217;t land there any time soon. A third runway has been under discussion for decades.</p><h3>The money programme</h3><p class="has-stop">Reports emerged that the British government is considering extending the <b>&#8220;licence fee&#8221;</b> that funds the <small>BBC</small> to users of streaming services such as Netflix and Disney+. The licence fee is a tax on households that own a television or any other device that broadcasts live programming. Households that view only Netflix and the like have been exempt. But the <small>BBC</small> needs its money. Another proposal is to tax streaming directly, raising the prospect of &#8220;Squid Game 2&#8221; subsidising &#8220;EastEnders&#8221;.</p>
