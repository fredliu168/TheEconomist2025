        <section class="article__body">
          <p>Goma, the largest city in the east of the <b>Democratic Republic of Congo</b>, fell to <small>M23,</small> an armed group backed by <b> Rwanda</b>. The capture of Goma marks a stunning escalation of hostilities between Paul Kagame, Rwanda&#8217;s president, and his country&#8217;s much larger neighbour. African and Western diplomats have roundly condemned the attack but are unlikely to force Mr Kagame to reverse course. The incursion raises the risk of a wider conflict in the region, which suffered two devastating wars between 1996 and 2003.</p><p><b>Burkina Faso</b>, <b>Mali</b> and <b>Niger</b> left the Economic Community of West African States, Africa&#8217;s main regional bloc, and unveiled a common passport for their Alliance of Sahel States. The trio of military regimes claim they left <small>ECOWAS</small> because it failed to help them fight jihadists. But the more likely reason is their desire to escape pressure to hand power back to civilian governments.</p><p><b>Israel</b> opened part of the Netzarim corridor into northern <b>Gaza</b> to allow displaced Palestinians to return to what remains of their homes. It opened the route 48 hours later than expected after disputes with Hamas over which hostages would be released as part of the ceasefire. More than 300,000 Palestinians returned to the area, which has been devastated in the war.</p><p>Donald Trump invited Binyamin Netanyahu to visit the White House. The <b>Israeli prime minister</b> is the first foreign leader to be invited during Mr Trump&#8217;s second term. Mr Trump also resumed shipments of 2,000lb (907kg) bunker-buster bombs to Israel. Deliveries were suspended under Joe Biden last year.</p><p>A law banning activity by <small>UNRWA</small>, the <small>UN&#8217;</small>s agency for Palestinians, on Israeli soil came into effect. The Israeli government says <small>UNRWA</small> is complicit with Hamas and that some of its employees took part in the massacres of October 7th. It is unclear how the ban will affect <small>UNRWA&#8217;</small>s activities in Gaza or the West Bank.</p><p>Ahmed al-Sharaa, <b>Syria&#8217;s</b> de facto ruler since the ousting of Bashar al-Assad, declared himself the country&#8217;s interim president. He also announced the dissolution of Mr Assad&#8217;s Baath party and the formation of a legislative council to govern Syria until a new constitution can be agreed.</p><p>An <b>American Airlines flight</b> from Wichita carrying 64 people crashed into the Potomac river by Washington, <small>DC.</small> The plane collided with an army Black Hawk helicopter that had three people on board. Roger Marshall, a senator from Kansas, described the &#8220;unbearable sorrow&#8221; of many people dying.</p><p>Confusion reigned in Washington after the <b>White House</b> issued and then retracted a memorandum that aimed to freeze trillions of dollars in federal loans and grants. A judge had suspended the edict. Separately, most federal workers were given the option of resigning with eight months&#8217; pay. The State Department, meanwhile, seemed to back away a little from an earlier announcement to pause nearly all <b>foreign-aid spending</b>.</p><p>The <b>Justice Department</b> fired a dozen lawyers who had worked on the two criminal investigations into Mr Trump during Joe Biden&#8217;s presidency. A spokesman said they could not be trusted to implement the new president&#8217;s agenda. The head of the department&#8217;s public-integrity section decided to step down.</p><p><b>Robert Menendez</b>, a former Democratic senator from New Jersey, was sentenced to 11 years in prison for accepting bribes and acting as a foreign agent for Egypt. After the conviction was read out, Mr Menendez seemed to make an appeal to Mr Trump to pardon him, saying the president could restore &#8220;integrity&#8221; to the justice system.</p><h3>Hardball diplomacy</h3><p>Mr Trump threatened to impose stiff tariffs on <b> Colombia</b>, after the country&#8217;s leftist president, Gustavo Petro, said he would not allow American military planes carrying Colombians deported from the United States to land. Mr Petro soon backed down and offered his presidential plane to transport the migrants. Mr Trump lifted the threat of tariffs and the first migrants arrived back in Bogotá, Colombia&#8217;s capital, on Colombian military aircraft.</p><p><b>South Korea&#8217;s</b> president, Yoon Suk Yeol, was officially charged with insurrection over his order in December that briefly imposed martial law. A former defence minister and several security chiefs have been similarly charged. Mr Yoon&#8217;s separate impeachment trial is being heard by the Constitutional Court.</p><p>Dozens of people were killed in a stampede at the Maha Kumbh Mela religious festival in northern <b> India</b>. Hundreds of millions of Hindus attend the six-week event attempting to take a ritual dip in waters that are considered sacred.</p><p>The <b>German</b> parliament passed non-binding measures to restrict migration, including the automatic refusal of entry to illegal migrants. The proposals were put forward by Friedrich Merz, the leader of the Christian Democratic Union parliamentary bloc, which is on track to win the forthcoming general election. Mr Merz sparked outrage by turning to the Alternative for Germany (<small>A</small>f<small>D</small>) to help pass his measures, breaking a long-standing convention of snubbing the hard right.</p><p>Estonia and Lithuania promised to increase their spending on defence to more than 5% of <small>GDP,</small> a level that Donald Trump has called on <small>NATO</small> countries to aim for. A <b>NATO</b> summit in June is likely to raise spending targets for its members above the current 2% of <small>GDP.</small></p><p>Milos Vucevic resigned as prime minister of <b>Serbia</b>, following weeks of protests over the collapse of a railway-station roof in Novi Sad, the country&#8217;s second-biggest city, which killed 15 people. The roof collapsed after renovations that were carried out by a Chinese-led consortium. The fall of Mr Vucevic is a blow to Aleksandar Vucic, Serbia&#8217;s president.</p><h3>Never forget</h3><figure class="media media--picture media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250201_WWP002.jpg"></div></figure><p class="has-stop">The remaining survivors of the <b>Auschwitz</b> death camp commemorated the 80th anniversary of its liberation. The Nazis murdered 1.1m people at the camp, 1m of whom were Jewish; 6m Jews were killed in the Holocaust overall. Several world leaders attended the commemorative event, including Emmanuel Macron, Volodymyr Zelensky, Olaf Scholz and King Charles. None made a speech; that was left for the survivors to do. Surveys in various countries have revealed a lack of awareness about what happened during the Holocaust, especially among younger people.</p>
