        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">R</span><small>ARELY HAS</small> the Bundestag known such drama. On January 29th, to scenes of uproar, a tiny majority of German <small>MP</small>s backed a five-point plan to curb irregular immigration. The non-binding motion was introduced by Friedrich Merz, head of the centre-right Christian Democrats (<small>CDU</small>) and the favourite to take over as chancellor after the election on February 23rd. Among other matters, it proposed permanent controls on Germany&#8217;s borders and a &#8220;de facto entry ban&#8221;: the rejection of any immigrants lacking papers, including asylum-seekers.</p><p>That was controversial enough. The Social Democrats (<small>SPD</small>) and Greens, who rule in a minority coalition, said the proposals violated <small>EU</small> and German law. What tipped the row into pandemonium was that the motion passed only with backing from the hard-right Alternative for Germany (<small>A</small>f<small>D</small>)&#8212;even though the <small>CDU</small> had packed the text with poison pills painting the party as a Putin-loving threat to democracy.</p><p>Olaf Scholz, the <small>SPD</small> chancellor, compared Mr Merz to Viktor Orban, Hungary&#8217;s strongman, and called his decision to accept <small>A</small>f<small>D</small> support &#8220;unforgivable&#8221;. The Greens&#8217; Robert Habeck spoke of a &#8220;steep path to the abyss&#8221;. Mr Merz said he &#8220;regretted&#8221; the fact that the <small>A</small>f<small>D</small> was needed, but blamed the governing parties for refusing to support him. Only one party was satisfied. Alice Weidel, the <small>A</small>f<small>D</small>&#8217;s co-leader, hailed &#8220;a great day for democracy&#8221;.</p><p>The backdrop to the drama was the murder last week in Aschaffenburg, a town in Bavaria, of two people by an Afghan who should have been deported. Similar incidents in recent months have jangled Germans&#8217; nerves, after years in which annual asylum claims have exceeded 200,000, overwhelming local authorities.</p><p>Following the attack, Mr Merz said he would impose his entry ban on &#8220;day one&#8221; of his government, adding that coalition partners would have to agree. A flurry of political machinations and bitter debates ensued. After Mr Merz said he would not let <small>A</small>f<small>D</small> support dissuade him, tens of thousands took to the streets in protest.</p><p>Nor is this chapter over. On January 31st the Bundestag will vote on a further <small>CDU</small> motion, this one legally binding, to expand police powers and restrict the rights of some migrants to bring family to Germany. It also looks set to pass with <small>A</small>f<small>D</small> votes.</p><p>Whether all this constitutes a violation of the anti-<small>A</small>f<small>D</small> &#8220;firewall&#8221; that binds Germany&#8217;s mainstream parties is doubtful. Mr Merz did not co-ordinate with the <small>A</small>f<small>D</small>, and retains his commitment to veto coalitions with the party. This week&#8217;s spectacle was made possible only because the collapse of Germany&#8217;s coalition in November left a majority of seats in opposition hands.</p><p>Yet two questions hang over the man seeking Germany&#8217;s highest office. The first is on his political judgment. Mr Merz&#8217;s team insist that the only way to undermine the <small>A</small>f<small>D</small> is to hang tough on illegal immigration. But most analysts think inflaming the migration debate will help the <small>A</small>f<small>D</small>. It may also put off centrist <small>CDU</small> voters, 73% of whom reject working with the <small>A</small>f<small>D</small>. &#8220;This is fatal for the <small>CDU</small>,&#8221; says Peter Matuschek of Forsa, a pollster. Nor will the votes change policy. Even if it passes the Bundestag the <small>CDU</small> amendment will fail in the Bundesrat, the upper house.</p><p>The gambit could also snarl up coalition talks. As <i>The Economist</i>&#8217;s new election model suggests, Mr Merz will probably have to negotiate with the <small>SPD</small> or Greens (or possibly both). Neither is likely to agree to rewriting Germany&#8217;s constitutional right to claim asylum. By defining his proposals as non-negotiable, Mr Merz risks having to eat his words even before taking office. That would only confirm many observers&#8217; fears that he is too impulsive for the job. &#8220;He knows this is a high-risk strategy,&#8221; says an aide.</p><p>The second question is on Mr Merz&#8217;s ideas. His pledges to restore Germany&#8217;s position at the heart of Europe are hard to square with a unilateral vow to close its borders. (Austria&#8217;s chancellor has already cried foul.) The <small>CDU</small> claims <small>EU</small> law allows governments to supersede European rules in &#8220;emergency&#8221; situations. But, notes Svenja Niederfranke, a migration expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations, European judges have always rejected bids to pull this lever&#8212;and in Germany&#8217;s case, illegal entries have anyway been falling.</p><p class="end has-stop">Mr Merz is not wrong that most Germans want a tougher approach to illegal immigration. But he now faces charges of proposing bad ideas with no prospect of passing that risk damaging his party while weakening a crucial political taboo. With three weeks to go, Mr Merz&#8217;s big polling lead has left it his election to lose. Some in his ranks may now be getting nervous. </p>
