        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">T</span><small>HE FINAL</small> battle for the small Donbas town of Velyka Novosilka dragged on for six days, though the outcome was obvious long before that. Things became critical early in the new year, when Russian troops took over villages immediately to its north-east and west, pinching the Ukrainian defenders on three sides. By January 23rd the narrow corridor to what had become a nearly-isolated pocket had become impassable. The order to retreat came as soon as a mist descended. It was a nightmarish task that had to be completed on foot, under drone-filled skies, and across a river. The evidence of triumphant Russian propaganda channels suggests that many failed to make it.</p><p>Russia&#8217;s small victory in Velyka Novosilka (population just 5,000 before the war) followed a familiar pattern: relentless infantry assaults, devastating casualties, collapsing Ukrainian defences, and eventual retreat. The immediate focus for the units that had been fighting there will now probably shift back to Pokrovsk to the north, a much-bigger logistical hub that Russia has been attacking with various intensities for the past six months. The fighting there has already prompted the Ukrainians to abandon a crucial coking-coal mine.</p><p>The Kremlin&#8217;s plan probably depends on where it can make quick progress. The minimum requirement of its &#8220;special military operation&#8221; still appears to be occupying the entire Donbas region (comprising the provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk), regaining control of Russia&#8217;s own Kursk region, which Ukraine has partly occupied, and holding on to the &#8220;land bridge&#8221; it seized in the early stages of the war connecting Crimea to Russia. In Kursk, Russia has yet to regain the initiative, despite having deployed a force that is supplemented by North Korean fighters and, at 62,000, is perhaps three times larger than the Ukrainian grouping. In the Donbas, meanwhile, driving Ukraine out of the remaining cities, which are large and well-defended, will not be easy. The open fields that lie immediately west of Pokrovsk and a psychologically damaging push into Dnipropetrovsk province may prove more enticing. &#8220;They probe for our weak points,&#8221; says Andriy Cherniak, a military-intelligence officer. &#8220;And then they mass force wherever they have tactical success.&#8221;</p><figure class="media media--map media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250201_EUM919.png"></div></figure><p>The Russian tactics are not dynamic, but are causing Ukraine no end of bother. Put simply, Russia has the infantry and Ukraine does not. Issues with mobilisation and desertion have hit Ukraine&#8217;s reserves hard. &#8220;We struggle to replace our battlefield losses,&#8221; says Colonel Pavlo Fedosenko, the commander of a Ukrainian tactical grouping in the Donbas. &#8220;They might throw a battalion&#8217;s worth of soldiers at a position we&#8217;ve manned with four or five soldiers.&#8221; The brigades that make up the Donbas front line are understaffed, under pressure, and cracking. The front line keeps creeping back. &#8220;We no longer have tactics beyond plugging holes,&#8221; says &#8220;Kupol&#8221;, the <i>nom de guerre</i> of a now-retired commander who until September led a brigade fighting in eastern Donbas. &#8220;We throw battalions into the chaotic mess and hope we can somehow stop the grind.&#8221;</p><p class="end has-stop">Three years into its attritional fight, it is still unclear whether Russia can turn its many tactical gains into something bigger&#8212;enough to press deeper behind Ukraine&#8217;s weakening lines and to cause real worry. Mr Cherniak says the evidence so far suggests that this is unlikely. &#8220;We see their reserves, their missiles, their armour&#8212;and it&#8217;s not enough. Not yet.&#8221; Captain Ivan Sekach, an officer with Ukraine&#8217;s 110th Brigade defending Velyka Novosilka, thinks luck may also have played a role. Russian armoured columns on more than one occasion broke through the town&#8217;s front line and got behind Ukrainian defences, but without realising it. Lost and disoriented, they turned back. &#8220;The Russian army doesn&#8217;t reward smart people, that&#8217;s my only explanation,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But we can&#8217;t count on it staying that way.&#8221; </p>
