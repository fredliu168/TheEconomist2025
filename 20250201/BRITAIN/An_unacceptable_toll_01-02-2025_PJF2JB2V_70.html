        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">T</span><small>RAVERSING THE</small> Pennines along the Snake Pass between Manchester and Sheffield makes for a dramatic alpine-like drive. It can be a dangerous one, too, especially when the fog rolls in (as it did when <i>The Economist</i> drove the route recently). Because of its sharp bends and high elevation, the road is an accident black spot. This section of the <small>A</small>57 is more dangerous than almost any other stretch of tarmac in the country.</p><p>Britain once led the world in road safety. Between 1960 and 2000 the number of people who died in road collisions fell by half. The decline in deaths per mile travelled was even more dramatic (see chart). By 2010 Britain&#8217;s roads were, along with Sweden&#8217;s, the safest in the world. Progress has since stalled. Whereas Sweden implemented &#8220;Vision Zero&#8221;&#8212;a goal of reducing deaths to nil&#8212;in 2011 Britain&#8217;s Conservative-led government ditched its road-safety target altogether. Britain&#8217;s roads remain safe by international standards. But road deaths are now a third higher per mile travelled than in the Scandinavian country that invented the three-point seatbelt.</p><figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250201_BRC498.png"></div></figure><p>In 2023, 1,624 people died on Britain&#8217;s roads and another 26,000 suffered serious, often life-changing injuries. Road collisions cost the country about £40bn ($50bn, or 1.5% of <small>GDP</small>) each year, factoring in the value of lost life-years. They are the second-most-common cause of death among men in their 20s after suicide. The Labour government will soon publish a strategy that may attempt to emulate Sweden&#8217;s approach. That would require repairing roads, reducing speed limits and tackling bad driving. The question, says Suzy Charman of the Road Safety Foundation, a charity, is &#8220;How much death and serious injury is society willing to tolerate?&#8221;</p><p>Repairs are needed because roads are in a dire state. A parliamentary-committee report published on January 17th labelled the road network a &#8220;national embarrassment&#8221;. In December the government announced £1.6bn of funding to fill potholes and the like. The Asphalt Industry Alliance, a lobby group, says £16bn is needed to tackle the backlog. Targeting more money on black spots may be the best way to reduce deaths and serious injuries.</p><p>As well as improving roads, policymakers could reduce speed limits. Many experts think the national speed limit of 60mph (97kph) on single-carriageway roads is too high, considering how lethal head-on collisions are. Rural single-carriageway roads where the speed limit is 60mph account for one-third of all the deaths. The Scottish government is consulting on whether to cut its national speed limit to 50mph.</p><p>That is likely to be unpopular. About half of Wales was opposed when its government reduced the speed limit in built-up areas from 30mph to 20mph in 2023. The scheme has worked, reducing deaths and serious injuries in those areas by 15%. But it has been so controversial that it may be weakened. &#8220;Unfortunately, it seems that people tend to value their own speedy journey over someone else&#8217;s life,&#8221; says Dr Helen Wells of Keele University.</p><p>A fifth of all serious road collisions involve at least one driver aged between 17 and 24, despite young drivers accounting for just 7% of licence-holders. The <small>RAC</small> Foundation, a lobby group, proposes that drivers under 20 should not be allowed to carry passengers younger than 25 for six months after they pass their test, unless an older adult is also present. It thinks the restriction could save 44 lives a year.</p><p>Safety campaigners also worry about distractions in modern cars. Research shows that hands-free phone calls (which are legal) impair motorists&#8217; performance just as much as holding a mobile phone (which is not). Britain pioneered research into in-car safety standards, such as automated emergency braking and lane assistance. But its exit from the <small>EU</small> distracted governments from adopting them.</p><p class="end has-stop">Such examples of drift abound. In 2008 Chris Taylor&#8217;s 18-year-old daughter, Rebecca, died when her car burst into flames after a collision with another vehicle on a Northamptonshire country lane. It took 12 months before Mr Taylor fully understood the cause of her death. In 2022 the government promised to create a &#8220;road-safety investigation branch&#8221; to match those for air, rail and maritime transport, but the plan was dropped. After a decade of stalled efforts, the route to safer roads is clear. </p>
