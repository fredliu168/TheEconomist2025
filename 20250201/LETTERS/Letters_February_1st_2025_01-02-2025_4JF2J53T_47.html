          <h3>Speaking Russian in Ukraine</h3><p>Imagine, for a moment, a respected British publication printing this: &#8220;Indian politicians are struggling to Indianise Bombay (which they spell as Mumbai) and to make it fit into their decolonisation law.&#8221; Scandalous. And yet, there it was in <i>The Economist</i>, levelled not at India but at Ukraine (&#8220;Cancel culture in Ukraine&#8221;, December 21st).</p><p>I am a Russian-speaking Ukrainian. Your article claims to speak for people like me. Thanks, but no thanks. The last thing I need is a sanctimonious lecture on how &#8220;Russian is not only the language of the aggressor, it is also the language of the victim.&#8221; It may very well be, but it is the language of the murderous aggressor first and foremost. It is the language of the empire, which denied Ukraine nationhood and suppressed Ukrainian culture for decades. Moscow is now trying to re-colonise the land, no cost is too high, and no war crime is too heinous. Out of respect, we should postpone a conversation about the role of Russian culture in Ukraine until after Russian soldiers stop killing Ukrainians for being Ukrainian.</p><p>Your article evokes a mysterious Putin&#8217;s war. There is no such thing. Ask a Ukrainian. Was it Vladimir Putin who killed their loved ones? Was it Mr Putin who bombed their home in the middle of the night, children sleeping peacefully in their beds? Back in the 1930s, there was no Mr Putin around when Moscow manufactured genocide by famine that took millions of innocent Ukrainian lives. From the tsars to commissars, Russia&#8217;s leaders change, the violence remains.</p><p>Your article yearns to celebrate Odesa as a cosmopolitan city and a melting pot of cultures. I&#8217;m all for that. Odesa is a city I&#8217;ve visited many times, where I have friends and it is a place I love. But let us wait until after the Russian people atone for what they have done.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>ANDREW CHAKHOYAN</small></div><div class="letter-info__title">Academic director, Multilateralism, Globalisation and Corporate Diplomacy</div><div class="letter-info__organisation">Graduate School of Social Sciences, University of Amsterdam</div></div><p>Your essay was a productive intervention on behalf of Ukraine&#8217;s future, which was appreciated by many in Odessa. The liberal Anglophone press has been reluctant to criticise Ukraine&#8217;s internal politics for fear of inadvertently supporting Mr Putin&#8217;s claims. But war radicalises politics.</p><p>Since Russia&#8217;s invasion in February 2022 a dangerous narrative has gained momentum in Ukraine calling for the eviction of everything Russophone from the country. A minority of radical ethno-nationalists has taken advantage of war trauma to insist that the Russian language itself carries Russia&#8217;s murderous imperialism, and that all traces of it must be erased. This dangerous ideology, presented as patriotism, has circulated in Ukrainian social and mass media, largely unopposed.</p><p>It is based on a political lie because murderous imperialism can be articulated equally well in Japanese, German, Italian, English and Russian. It is dangerous because Russian is spoken on both sides of this war, by Russian murderers and Ukrainian defenders and victims alike.</p><p>This poses a serious social and political threat. Millions of Ukrainians, including soldiers, speak Russian. So attacks on &#8220;Moscow-mouthed&#8221; speakers of the &#8220;enemy tongue&#8221; alienate millions of Ukrainian citizens and could even provoke civil war. The Kremlin may well have spent billions on the Ukrainian right. After all, the division of enemy societies along ethnic lines is the crux of General Valery Gerasimov&#8217;s doctrine of &#8220;hybrid war.&#8221;</p><p>More surprising is the endorsement of this attack on the Russian language by Ukraine&#8217;s own government under a president who won election on a stridently liberal, anti-ethnic platform. Since the invasion a slew of discriminatory, unconstitutional laws have banned the use of Russian across educational, cultural, service and information spaces. Russian no longer exists even as a school subject. A bill proposing to outlaw Russian speech in school corridors is under review. One cannot publish or send Russian-language books, including by Ukrainian writers. Contrary to Mr Putin&#8217;s narrative, these are the consequences rather than the causes of his war.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>ANASTASIA PILIAVSKY</small></div><div class="letter-info__title">Anthropologist</div><div class="letter-info__organisation">King&#8217;s College London</div></div><p>For a full list of signatories to this letter please visit www.economist.com/letters</p><p>Lazar Vaisbein, or Waissbein, better known as Leonid Utesov, was not just &#8220;a singer and bandleader popular from the 1920s&#8221; who mixed klezmer and jazz (I am a descendant of his). Born in Odessa he was a celebrated actor, director and composer. He performed in Sverdlov Square in Moscow on Victory Day in May 1945, and was the first comic actor and singer to be awarded the prestigious title of People&#8217;s Artist of the <small>USSR</small> in 1965. Prior to that, in 1934, he had starred in the first ever Soviet musical, &#8220;Jolly Fellows&#8221;, which was seen by millions of devoted fans. He was the object of a Russian postage stamp issued in 1999.</p><p>He had been also, to boot, a favourite of Stalin, who decorated him on several occasions. His statue is to be seen in many Russian and Ukrainian towns and cities. He remains to this day one of the most popular entertainment figures, known to everyone in what are now two different countries.</p><p>Utesov sang and acted in Russian, Ukrainian and Yiddish, and would have been horrified at what the attempts at cultural &#8220;decolonisation&#8221; are doing to the city of his birth. The inextricable integration of the three cultural strains is what stamped Odessa with its unique seal and produced everything that is of value and interest that comes from that region. Such attempts also show an amazing ignorance of history. Far from being Russia that &#8220;colonised&#8221; the Ukraine, it was the latter that gave birth to the former in the Middle Ages.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>DANIEL WAISSBEIN</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Oxford</i></div></div><h3>Clap trap</h3><p>A Back Story column (January 11th) reported on the latest trend for theatre audiences to stand and applaud even the dullest of performances, or &#8220;ovation inflation&#8221;. Dorothy Parker once described Katharine Hepburn&#8217;s performance in &#8220;The Lake&#8221; as &#8220;running the gamut of emotions from <small>A</small> to <small>B.</small>&#8221; The play still managed to generate loud applause. Things have changed. I remember when John Osborne&#8217;s &#8220;Look Back in Anger&#8221; opened to a mixed reaction from the audience at London&#8217;s Royal Court theatre in the 1960s. And heckling has a long theatrical tradition. Audiences threw tomatoes and other projectiles at the cast of Shakespeare&#8217;s plays. That tradition is neatly summed up in the apocryphal story of a turgid production of &#8220;The Diary of Anne Frank&#8221;, when one member of the audience shouted at the arriving German soldiers, &#8220;She&#8217;s in the attic&#8221;.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>DAVID WOODS</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Philadelphia</i></div></div><p>The encore has also become a meaningless ritual at rock concerts. No longer is there any suspense about whether the band will come back and play a few additional songs as a reward for audience enthusiasm.</p><p>By stark contrast, in &#8220;The Song Remains The Same&#8221;, a documentary about Led Zeppelin&#8217;s 1973 tour, the band finish their set, wave to the exuberant crowd and then happily proceed directly to their waiting limousines.</p><div class="letter-info has-stop"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>STEVE KATZ</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Falls Church, Virginia</i></div></div>
