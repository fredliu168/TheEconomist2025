        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">T</span><small>HE HOLIDAY</small> season is a time for family, food&#8212;and, at least for some people, American football. As in previous years, teams in the National Football League (<small>NFL</small>) played on Christmas day, watched live by millions. Unusually, though, the broadcaster this year was Netflix, which live-streamed two games (and a musical interlude by Beyoncé).</p><p>That it went off with only minor hitches was a gift for the company. Netflix&#8217;s previous forays into live sport have at times been shambolic. A celebrity boxing match in November between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson was beset by technical problems. &#8220;We crashed the site,&#8221; Mr Paul bragged after he beat his 58-year-old opponent. A live golfing event featured broken microphones and an animal-rights protester.</p><p>Netflix has big ambitions for live sport. American Football is set to stay in the streamer&#8217;s Christmas line-up for at least the next two years. World Wrestling Entertainment (<small>WWE</small>) Raw, a hit show, will leave traditional <small>TV</small> for a weekly spot on the streaming site from January 6th. Netflix has also bagged the American rights for the next two women&#8217;s football (soccer) World Cups.</p><p>Netflix used to insist it would stay on the sidelines when it came to screening live sport. Cost was one reason. Broadcasting rights are expensive: the <small>NFL</small> pocketed $75m a game from Netflix for this year&#8217;s Christmas screenings, and the decade-long <small>WWE</small> deal cost a knockout $5bn. Then there were the technical challenges. Handling so many concurrent viewers is a headache for a streaming service designed for fragmented viewership.</p><p>But big sporting events attract prestige and, more important, subscribers. For all its mishaps, Jake Paul v Mike Tyson drew a record-breaking audience&#8212;and 1.4m new subscriptions, according to Antenna Data, a research firm. Live sport offers ample downtime before and during games, making it well-suited to ad breaks, a lucrative source of revenue. Even subscribers to Netflix&#8217;s ad-free packages were shown commercials during the <small>NFL</small> broadcast.</p><p>Challenges remain. To the relief of Netflix&#8217;s engineers, though perhaps not its bosses, viewing figures for its Christmas <small>NFL</small> games were good but not exceptional. The audience peaked at more than 27m, around half that drawn by Jake Paul v Mike Tyson. By comparison, the Super Bowl, the <small>NFL</small>&#8217;s biggest annual event, attracts well over 100m viewers. Streaming to such multitudes could be technically fraught.</p><p class="end has-stop">Still, Netflix has plenty of other options. Besides American football and the usual roster of classic Christmas films, the streamer had another hit programme on December 25th: a recording of a crackling log fire. </p>
