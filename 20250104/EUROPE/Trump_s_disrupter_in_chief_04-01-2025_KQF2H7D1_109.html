        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">A</span><small>LICE WEIDEL</small> could hardly have hoped for better publicity. With federal elections due on February 23rd, Ms Weidel is running for chancellor as co-head of the hard-right Alternative for Germany (<small>A</small>f<small>D</small>) party. In an op-ed on December 29th in the Sunday edition of <i>Welt</i>, a conservative paper, Elon Musk, the world&#8217;s richest man and a confidant of Donald Trump, called the <small>A</small>f<small>D</small> &#8220;the last spark of hope&#8221; for Germany. The country, he claimed, is &#8220;teetering on the brink of economic and cultural collapse&#8221;. He had a right to speak out about German politics, he said, because he has invested heaps of money in the country. (A multibillion-dollar plant in Brandenburg producing cars and batteries for Tesla, his electric carmaker, opened in 2022.)</p><p>The <small>A</small>f<small>D</small> is polling at 19%, putting it second behind the centre-right alliance of the Christian Democratic Union and Bavaria&#8217;s Christian Social Union, at about 30%. It is not the first hard-right European party to attract Mr Musk&#8217;s support: earlier in 2024 he praised Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister. Mr Musk said she was &#8220;even more beautiful on the inside than she is on the outside&#8221;. She in turn called him a &#8220;precious genius&#8221;. He is said to be considering a donation to Britain&#8217;s anti-immigrant Reform <small>UK</small> party.</p><p>Mr Musk&#8217;s love-note to the <small>A</small>f<small>D</small> may have been counterproductive. It certainly incensed Germany&#8217;s leaders, already anxious about Mr Trump&#8217;s second term in office. &#8220;I can&#8217;t remember a comparable case of interference in the election campaign of a friendly country in the history of the Western democracies,&#8221; said Friedrich Merz, the <small>CDU</small> leader and chancellor candidate, on December 29th. Olaf Scholz, the current chancellor and candidate for the Social Democrats, noted in his New Year&#8217;s Eve speech that Germany&#8217;s fate is decided by its citizens, not &#8220;by the owners of social media&#8221;. Mr Musk owns X, a social-media platform. His recent posts there have been childishly offensive: one called Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German president, an &#8220;anti-democratic tyrant&#8221;; another called the chancellor &#8220;Oaf Schitz&#8221;.</p><p>The op-ed editor of <i>Welt ,</i> Eva Marie Kogel, quit in protest after Mr Musk&#8217;s article was published. The piece had been accompanied by a rebuttal by Jan Philipp Burgard, the paper&#8217;s incoming editor-in-chief, calling Mr Musk &#8220;fatally wrong&#8221;. The rebuttal&#8217;s headline calls the <small>A</small>f<small>D &#8220;</small>partly xenophobic and antisemitic&#8221;; Mr Burgard also blasts its anti-Americanism and its endorsement of leaving the European Union. Yet like Ms Kogel, many Germans found it wrong to have run Mr Musk&#8217;s piece at all.</p><p class="end has-stop">Mr Musk&#8217;s op-ed was poorly argued. Yet the furore around its publishing seems unexpectedly to have shaped the early phase of the campaign. In the long run this may not prove terribly important: social-media algorithms, misinformation and Russian influence campaigns could have far more impact, as Michael Hanfeld, a German pundit, argued in the <i>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung,</i> a daily. But for the moment, the affair has had the odd effect of aligning the <small>A</small>f<small>D</small> with an American oligarch, making the Alternative for Germany seem slightly un-German. </p>
