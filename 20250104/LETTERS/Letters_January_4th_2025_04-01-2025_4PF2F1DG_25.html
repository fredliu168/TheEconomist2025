        <section class="article__body">
          <h3>Excluding Taiwan</h3><p>Your piece on &#8220;Which economy did best in 2024?&#8221; (December 14th) omitted Taiwan, presumably because it is excluded from most international statistics. According to the <small>IMF,</small> Taiwan grew almost a percentage point faster than Spain, which topped your list of the best economies. Taiwan&#8217;s stockmarket grew twice as fast as Spain&#8217;s index. Its inflation was slower, nearly spot-on its 2% target. The unemployment rate has held steady below 3.5%.</p><p>This omission from global statistics continues a long pattern. Yet Taiwan has ascended in less than a century from poverty to an economy marked by high incomes and from martial law to being among the freest in the world, according to the Bertelsmann Foundation. Perhaps it is time for believers in liberalism to ditch the conspiracy of silence orchestrated by a communist dictatorship against the developed country with the smallest and most efficient state in the world.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>E. GLEN WEYL</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Arlington, Massachusetts</i></div></div><h3>Properly informed citizens</h3><p>Bagehot (December 7th) was right to decry the lack of good data to support effective decision-making. Without good information any policy is likely to be at best an inspired guess, at worst a chimeric ectoplasm of the policymaker&#8217;s mind. But maybe policymakers would actually prefer their data to be less than perfect, so that they can make facts on the ground, rather than being driven by present-day reality.</p><p>You can argue with the specifics, but the distortions of arguments on both sides in the Brexit campaign, debates over the efficacy, or otherwise, of vaccines or lockdowns during covid-19, and government unwillingness to collect statistics on immigration all point to a similar conclusion. A political predilection towards &#8220;my truth&#8221; rather than &#8220;the truth&#8221;.</p><p>Britain has an Office for National Statistics and an Office for Budget Responsibility. Both have a remit to produce objective assessments. If we are blind, as Bagehot argues, then we need these offices to be strengthened and their work to be expanded and better communicated to us all as active citizens. If politicians behave little better than solipsistic hobby-horse riders, then good data is as essential to the proper functioning of a democracy as the rule of law.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>SIMON DIGGINS</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire</i></div></div><p>One doesn&#8217;t get the impression from Bagehot that &#8220;discovering an extra Slough&#8221; in official data is a happy discovery. This is only the latest slighting of the town. From the crematorium in &#8220;Brave New World&#8221; to an invitation for &#8220;friendly bombs&#8221; to fall on it and the post-industrial grey of &#8220;The Office&#8221;, Slough&#8217;s boosters must have quite the job going up against Aldous Huxley, John Betjeman and David Brent. Despite this it has done well to attract companies like <small>DHL,</small> Telefónica and Lego and provide the enterprise the government so badly needs to pay for its promises.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>ALEXANDER MCPHERSON</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Toronto</i></div></div><h3>What is a processed food?</h3><p>Everyone knows that greens are good for your health and red meat is not. But everyone would laugh if I were to propose that red foods are dangerous and green ones healthy. I could prove my thesis making use of a few additional rules, such as postulating that some shades of red, tomatoes and apples for instance, should not be counted as red.</p><p>The Nova classification system, which sorts foods into four categories depending on the degree of processing they undergo, uses similar logic (&#8220;Still processing&#8221;, November 30th). There is no scientific justification for the assumption that the number of processing steps is of any relevance for the health properties of foods. Making &#8220;ultra-processed&#8221; popcorn or chips is exceedingly simple. Making &#8220;minimally processed&#8221; natural yogurt requires some 20 processes.</p><p>Heating is the process that affects foods the most, but heating is afforded no attention in Nova. It does not neatly fit into the processed or unprocessed scheme. In some cases it is essential for public health, in others it may induce carcinogens. And in a blatant example of the arbitrariness of the Nova classification, putting a loaf of bread into a bag moves it from the minimally processed to the ultra-processed category.</p><p>The flawed, but intuitively easy to grasp, label of ultra-processed food is a handy justification for blaming food-related health problems on profit-hungry food companies. And it enables politicians to divert funding from serious research to meaningless eye-catching interventions.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>PETR DEJMEK</small></div><div class="letter-info__title">Emeritus professor of food engineering</div><div class="letter-info__organisation">Lund University</div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Lund, Sweden</i></div></div><h3>The real Iranian regime</h3><p>The By Invitation (December 23rd) from M. Javad Zarif, Iran&#8217;s vice-president, was bother some, in that he did not admit to any wrongdoing by Iran to destabilise the region. Mr Zarif talked about the &#8220;sublime values&#8221; of non-interventionism, sovereignty and territorial integrity. Iran has violated these principles in Lebanon with Hizbullah, Yemen with the Houthis and Iraq with various Iranian-aligned militias. All these groups are funded by Iran with the goal of harming Israel.</p><p>Mr Zarif also talked of promoting a &#8220;safe and stable country where minorities and women can thrive&#8221; in Syria. In Iran the presidential campaign in 2024 did pledge to improve women&#8217;s rights, but the country continues to take backward steps in this regard. Publicly admitting to some harmful decisions would be a good first step for the regime. But no matter what Mr Zarif believes, Iran will continue to destabilise the region as long as people like Ali Khamenei are in power.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>BEN JONES</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>North Las Vegas, Nevada</i></div></div><p>Mr Zarif offered a compelling vision of regional collaboration under a new &#8220;dialogue association&#8221;. His column spoke of non-aggression pacts, economic integration, infrastructure projects and energy security. One might ask, why do we need security guarantees in the Strait of Hormuz? Only one government has ever talked of blockading it.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>YASIN KAY</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>London</i></div></div><h3>Scotland the brave</h3><p>The picture of the Clan Fraser headstone at Culloden Moor in your article about heritage tourism in Scotland made me smile (&#8220;A clamour for clans&#8221;, December 14th). Although much of the Scottish diaspora who visit Scotland may be well-informed about Scottish history, there are many who are not. I frequently walk or run across Culloden Moor, and I have been stopped on numerous occasions and asked for directions to Jamie Fraser&#8217;s grave. I used to point out that Jamie Fraser is a fictitious character in &#8220;Outlander&#8221;, which involves time travel, and that consequently there is no grave. Tired of continually being politely informed that I was mistaken, I now simply tell people that it&#8217;s the one over there with all the flowers on it, and hope that they enjoy their time in Scotland.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>DAVID CADDICK</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Inverness</i></div></div><h3>Stockmarket prediction</h3><p>Although I agree with Buttonwood that the valuation gap between American and non-American equities will correct itself (November 23rd) I am reminded of this apocryphal quote, often attributed to John Maynard Keynes: &#8220;The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.&#8221;</p><div class="letter-info has-stop"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>SUNNY MAHAJAN</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Jackson, Tennessee</i></div></div>
