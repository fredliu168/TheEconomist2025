Translated by Philip Gabriel.</span><span class="book-info__publisher">Knopf; 464 pages; $35. Harvill Secker; Â£25</span></div><h3></h3><p><span data-caps="initial">P</span><small>HILIP ROTH</small> never really left New Jersey. Saul Bellow could not keep his characters out of Chicago. And Haruki Murakami&#8217;s narrators&#8212;unmarried, often middle-aged men with solitary habits&#8212;continually slip into eerie netherworlds.</p><p>The alternative realm in the Japanese writer&#8217;s latest novel is the same one in which the narrator was marooned at the end of &#8220;Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World&#8221; (1985). It is a town surrounded by an impregnable wall and governed by an inscrutable, imposing Gatekeeper. In &#8220;Hard-Boiled Wonderland&#8221; this locale&#8212;where the nameless narrator reads &#8220;old dreams&#8221; from uni corn skulls in a library&#8212;was part of the narrator&#8217;s subconscious. It was a place he had created in his own mind.</p><p>In &#8220;The City and Its Uncertain Walls&#8221; characters find their way into that world. As a teenager, this narrator falls in love with a girl whose &#8220;real self&#8221; is in the alternative world; she vanishes; he matures, and one day he falls into a hole and wakes up in the other place. For the rest of the book the narrator flits between the two realms.</p><p>Mr Murakami links the novels throughout. (Both Raymond Chandler&#8217;s detective fiction and Jorge Luis Borges&#8217;s fantastical prose experiments seem to be influences.) In an afterword he writes that the tales stem from the same novella, &#8220;The City, and Its Uncertain Walls&#8221; (1980), and that the two novels are complementary. What distinguishes them is tone. &#8220;Hard-Boiled Wonderland&#8221; is a propulsive page-turner. &#8220;The City and Its Uncertain Walls&#8221; is more meditative: the work of an older author confident that he has earned readers&#8217; attention over his long career.</p><p>The novelist is 75; this is his first new novel in six years (and it is not entirely new). If this is Mr Murakami&#8217;s last work, how will he be remembered? He is best known for his mordant surrealism. But the flights of fancy work only because they are grounded in a detailed reality.</p><p class="end has-stop">The archetypal Murakami protagon ist is an observer. Stories happen to them: they rarely instigate conflict or set out looking for adventure without being prodded. Failure and unrequited longing define their romantic lives. The writer&#8217;s principal concern has always been the pain and necessity of learning to be alone, and the worthwhile difficulty of establishing real connections. Those concerns are universal. Mr Murakami&#8217;s compassionate rendering of them is why millions seek solitude to read his books.</p>
