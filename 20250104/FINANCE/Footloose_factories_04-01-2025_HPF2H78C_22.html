        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">F</span><small>OR DECADES</small>, China has put foreign capital to work. Officials pushed Western companies to trade technology for access to its vast market, helping build Chinese rivals that were often better and always cheaper. These upstarts began shipping goods westwards. The resulting &#8220;China shock&#8221; is often blamed for causing dislocation and despair in America&#8217;s heartlands. Now, though, it is China&#8217;s turn to worry. Its manufacturers are taking flight.</p><p>In the year to June, Chinese firms invested a record $177bn in non-financial assets abroad. More than four-fifths is likely to have been ploughed into &#8220;greenfield&#8221; projects, in which assets are built rather than bought, mostly in emerging markets. The total flow is equivalent to 1% of China&#8217;s <small>GDP</small>, about as much as Japanese conglomerates spent offshoring their low-value manufacturing each year in the mid-1980s. That wave of outbound foreign direct investment (<small>FDI</small>) remade global manufacturing, helping South-East Asian countries climb the value chain.</p><p>Chinese <small>FDI</small>, by contrast, is causing anxiety abroad and at home. China&#8217;s firms have resisted hiring local workers, buying from local suppliers or sharing tech. Chinese officials, meanwhile, fret about domestic industry being &#8220;hollowed out&#8221;.</p><figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250104_EPC261.png"></div></figure><p>American and Chinese policies led to the investment spree. Tariffs introduced by Donald Trump in his first term as president encouraged Chinese firms to shift their goods&#8217; country of origin so as to skirt duties. At the same time, operating in China became harder. Labour costs soared. Weak consumer spending and huge, state-sponsored growth in loans to manufacturers dragged producers into price wars.</p><p>Hence why Chinese firms are pouring cash into factories in emerging markets, including some making higher-value-added goods such as electric vehicles (<small>EV</small>s) and chips. It is a shift from 2014-16, when another investment surge occurred after the state urged firms to &#8220;go out&#8221;. Investors bought trophy assets in the West, such as the Waldorf Astoria hotel, to store cash, notes Thilo Hanemann of Rhodium Group, a research firm. In 2016 rich countries received 80% of China&#8217;s outbound investment. By 2023 their share was 30%.</p><p>The beneficiaries this time have been countries that act as &#8220;connectors&#8221;, through which China can retain access to Western markets. Many are in South-East Asia. Vietnam receives investment for low-value-added-goods production; Indonesia gets cash for critical minerals. Malaysia and Thailand are home to <small>EV</small> projects. Considering that all these countries want to make advanced goods, such flows should be welcome. Capital for factories or data centres is less flighty than money that trades emerging-market debt. Shovels in the ground have larger multiplier effects than acquisitions of existing businesses. Foreign investment brings spillovers, as technology and skills are shared.</p><figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250104_FNC260.png"></div></figure><p>Yet China&#8217;s splurge brings few of these benefits. Chinese firms prefer to import their own workers. The country&#8217;s recruitment platforms posted more than 418,000 new vacancies for positions involving overseas travel between January and November. Even in Germany, where skilled labour is readily available, a fifth of the workforce at <small>CATL</small>&#8217;s battery-making plant are Chinese. Locals &#8220;rarely make up more than half&#8221; of the workforce on Chinese-owned projects, says Ong Kian Ming, a former Malaysian deputy minister. A rule that projects should have an 80:20 split of local to foreign workers could never be enforced, a Malaysian official sheepishly admits.</p><h3>Lock and key</h3><p>China&#8217;s officials want to keep knowledge at home. The commerce ministry has told <small>EV</small> firms that core technology should not leave the country. In December the state began making firms obtain licences to export sensitive tech. Regulators want to limit foreign operations to &#8220;screwdriver&#8221; plants, in which workers assemble Chinese parts. Reliance on Chinese imports is reflected in trade imbalances. Members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (<small>ASEAN</small>) ran a deficit of $144bn with China in the first ten months of 2024, 38% higher than in the same period in 2023.</p><p>To make matters worse, Chinese firms are crushing rivals. With a factory comes market access. Chinese carmakers doubled their market share in Thailand, home to a new <small>BYD</small> plant, to 11% in 2023, squeezing not only competitors but also small firms that make parts. Suzuki, a Japanese carmaker, was among the 2,000 producers to shut factories in Thailand in the year to June, a 40% increase from 2022-23. A leading Thai auto-parts maker has warned upstream suppliers may be wiped out.</p><figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250104_FNC262.png"></div></figure><p>This is sowing dissatisfaction in countries that receive Chinese money. The country&#8217;s investors, says an official in Kuala Lumpur, &#8220;cannot just use our land without hiring our people or buying our products&#8221;. Malaysia will begin taxing firms based on how many foreigners they employ. <small>ASEAN</small> is also wrapping up a new trade agreement with China that is said to include commitments to share tech.</p><p>Faced with such pressures, Chinese investors might start to localise their operations. A representative at <small>CATL</small>&#8217;s plant in Thuringia, Germany, recently boasted its canteen now serves German food, alongside Chinese dishes. Asian officials are optimistic that entrants will establish new supply chains. But Chinese firms must also contend with politics at home. And the more localised overseas production becomes, the more Chinese policymakers see it as a threat to the domestic economy.</p><p>Although some Chinese economists argue that relocating low-value production will free China to focus on higher-value manufacturing, local governments want to hold on to even low-value exports. An official in Jinjiang, China&#8217;s &#8220;zipper capital&#8221;, told state media that migrating companies will fail to replicate the city&#8217;s supply chains. Officials in Jiaxing, a steel town, have quizzed firms on their offshoring intentions, warning of risks to economic stability from &#8220;disorderly outbound investments&#8221;. A state think-tank has urged officials to &#8220;keep the main part of leading enterprises in China as much as possible&#8221;.</p><p>Chinese policymakers are in more of a bind than in 2016, when they last worried about hollowing out. Then they throttled outbound flows, notes David Lubin of Chatham House, a think-tank. The state introduced foreign-exchange caps and a traffic-light system to limit and prohibit overseas investment, reducing flows by 35% in a year. Now China benefits from skirting American tariffs, notes Mr Lubin.</p><p class="end has-stop">Xi Jinping, China&#8217;s leader, still wants supply chains to be &#8220;self-determined and self-controlled&#8221;. He would prefer low-value industry to move to China&#8217;s poor interior. The National Development and Reform Commission, China&#8217;s economic planner, has praised Chongqing and Yunnan for attracting firms from richer areas. &#8220;Against the backdrop of the accelerated reconstruction of the global industrial chain,&#8221; wrote the department, China should use the &#8220;economic depth of a big country and retain the roots of the manufacturing industry.&#8221; Politics caused firms to take flight. It could yet summon them home. </p>
