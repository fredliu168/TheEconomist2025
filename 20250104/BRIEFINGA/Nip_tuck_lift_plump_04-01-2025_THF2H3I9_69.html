          <figure class="media media--drawing media--wide"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250104_FBD001.png"></div></figure><p><span data-caps="initial">L</span><small>IKE MANY</small> other members of the Lebanese community in the suburb of Boston where he grew up, Peter Makhlouf goes to Beirut every summer to visit family. Recently the annual trip has acquired an extra purpose. &#8220;At some point [the women] all started to do cosmetic procedures,&#8221; he says. They began with little tweaks, such as getting their lips plumped or teeth whitened. Then came cheekbone-lifts, nose jobs &#8220;and so on&#8221;. The plastic pilgrimage has become so common that Mr Makhlouf, who is 29, says he no longer knows &#8220;anyone who hasn&#8217;t gotten plastic surgery&#8221;.</p><p>He is not alone. Cosmetic procedures have been getting cheaper, less invasive and vastly more common in recent years, in middle-income countries as well as rich ones. Roughly a fifth of people in places like Brazil and China say they plan to purchase such treatments as anti-wrinkle injections in the next five years. The young are especially keen. The &#8220;medical aesthetics&#8221; business, already an $82bn industry, will almost double in size over the next five years, to $143bn, according to projections by Grand View Research, an American market-research firm.</p><p>As cosmetic interventions go mainstream, getting injected, lasered or operated on may become &#8220;similar to getting an annual check-up&#8221;, says Marcelo Araújo, a plastic surgeon in Brazil. Such touch-ups are already so common among the young that they have developed slang terms for them: &#8220;tweakments&#8221; and &#8220;upkeep&#8221;. Tiffany Demers, the founder of an app called Upkeep, where young people can book cosmetic injections, says 18-year-olds &#8220;don&#8217;t understand that this used to be stigmatised&#8221;. Today, she says, &#8220;It&#8217;s like, you know, buying lipstick or a make-up product.&#8221;</p><h3>Pixelated self-loathing</h3><p>The boom in cosmetic treatments seems to have been spurred in part by the pandemic. Anyone who spent hours in video-conferences can attest to the distress of seeing one&#8217;s face gazing sallowly from a computer screen. Like a mirror placed at an unflattering angle, Zoom calls highlighted sagging cheeks, creasing foreheads and drooping necks. With money saved up from lockdowns and time to recover during waves of social distancing, many people decided to go under the knife. In America in 2021 four-fifths of facial plastic surgeons reported an increase in patients seeking procedures explicitly to improve their appearance on video calls. Business duly surged. According to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (<small>ISAPS</small>), an industry group, the number of cosmetic procedures carried out globally, including non-invasive treatments such as filler injections, leapt from 25m in 2019 to 35m in 2023.</p><p>The true numbers are in fact much higher, since <small>ISAPS</small> surveys only certified plastic surgeons. In Iran, where nose jobs are commonplace, there are only around 400 accredited plastic surgeons but some 2,000 doctors offering cosmetic procedures. In China, where the industry doubled in size between 2021 and 2025, and is expected to double again by 2030, there are over six times more unlicensed plastic surgery clinics than licensed ones, industry analysts estimate. A recent study by David Zargaran and others at University College London found that over two-thirds of people administering anti-wrinkle or filler injections in Britain are not medical doctors.</p><p>The &#8220;Zoom boom&#8221; may have revved up the industry, but it has been long in the making. When cosmetic surgery took off in the 1980s and 1990s, it was the preserve of television stars. Falling costs and technology have democratised it. &#8220;In the era of social media there&#8217;s an extent to which everyone&#8212;even me, you, our friends and our neighbours&#8212;is public-facing,&#8221; says Lara Devgan, a plastic surgeon in New York.</p><p>Patients often bring in photos of themselves altered through filters on Instagram or applications like Facetune, an image-editing tool, and ask doctors to transform them into their digitally enhanced selves. &#8220;You construct a much better version of yourself on social media: you post selfies taken at the right angle, with perfect make-up, with filters,&#8221; says Chang Chia-jung, a Taiwanese influencer. &#8220;You want to become the version of yourself that exists in the apps.&#8221; So-Young, a Chinese online marketplace for plastic surgery, offers an app that lets users upload photos of themselves and provides suggestions for what plastic surgeries they can undergo to achieve more symmetrical faces. It then shows users certified surgeons in their area.</p><p>Few women have done more to popularise plastic surgery than Kim Kardashian, a reality-television star. A decade ago Ms Kardashian&#8217;s curvaceous body defined beauty standards in the West. An era of unnaturally pouty lips and exaggerated behinds followed. Between 2015 and 2023 the procedures that grew the most in demand globally were buttock augmentations and lifts. Demand for the &#8220;Brazilian butt lift&#8221;, which involves sucking fat out of one part of the body and inserting it into the bottom, has skyrocketed even though it is a relatively dangerous operation.</p><p>But the era of tumescent bottoms may be flattening out. &#8220;Now we are in the era of Ozempic and the &#8216;clean-girl look&#8217;, where everything is supposed to look natural, but better,&#8221; says Vera Pizzo, a 22-year-old Brazilian who has had several procedures. Ozempic, a diabetes and weight-loss drug, has led to increasingly svelte figures on red carpets. Ms Kardashian herself has lost a conspicuous amount of weight in recent years. In 2023 demand for breast-implant removal in America grew nearly five times as much as for breast augmentation (although from a lower base). Some of those who have lost weight fast want smaller breasts to complement leaner physiques and tight sports bras. &#8220;People have been all anti-boobs for the last year or so,&#8221; says Lisa Cassileth, a plastic surgeon in Los Angeles. Demand for tummy-tucks is also up as patients on Ozempic trim saggy skin from rapid weight-loss.</p><p>That the pendulum is already swinging back to skinniness suggests that beauty standards are changing more rapidly than in the past. &#8220;It used to take a while to disperse new beauty standards through advertisements and magazines,&#8221; says Dr Araújo. But with social media, &#8220;As soon as a new standard emerges, it can spread around the globe instantly.&#8221; Ms Pizzo laments that it is becoming expensive to keep up with the Kardashians. &#8220;You spend huge amounts of money and every few years you have to change your look&#8221;, she sighs.</p><p>Faster-changing consumer preferences are stimulating innovation in the products on offer. For instance, new anti-wrinkle injections are threatening to unseat Botox, which has dominated the market for so long that it has become synonymous with it. Revance, the firm that makes Daxxify, a rival anti-wrinkle injection, claims its effects last nearly twice as long. Sales have rocketed since it was approved by America&#8217;s Food and Drug Administration in late 2022. Hyaluronic-acid fillers are losing ground to other dermal fillers and new treatments that use the body&#8217;s own tissue, cells and blood platelets&#8212;or in some cases, salmon sperm&#8212;to plump the skin. &#8220;Energy-based devices&#8221; that use radiofrequency and ultrasound to target fat and skin imperfections are also proliferating. These can, for example, freeze fat without the need for painful and pricey liposuction.</p><p>All this bodes well for aestheticians. Better yet, as far as practitioners are concerned, the industry is largely recession-proof. During the financial crisis of 2007-09, aesthetic injectables sales contracted by only 2% globally and the share-prices of firms in the industry fell by less than 20% on average, even as the <small>S</small>&amp; <small>P</small> 500 contracted by half. Argentina and Iran have seen a surge in procedures despite dire economic conditions in both countries. Only 7% of American consumers of injectables say they would stop getting treatments during a recession. Most would simply switch to cheaper providers.</p><p>The pool of potential customers is also set to expand. In 2021 McKinsey, a consulting firm, surveyed 10,000 consumers in the world&#8217;s main aesthetics markets and found that 15-20% of respondents intended to use anti-wrinkle injections or dermal fillers within the next five years, which was double the share of users at the time of the survey. The ranks of these &#8220;fence-sitters&#8221; are composed chiefly of people aged between 20 and 50 who earn $50,000 to $100,000 a year. McKinsey reckons that around a third of them will indeed take the plunge, mostly in countries with enough competition to suppress prices.</p><h3>Sausage-lip factories</h3><p>Lower prices come in part from new, lower-cost business models. Non-invasive treatments used to be administered by plastic surgeons or dermatologists in clinics. But private-equity groups and venture capitalists have been piling into the industry, investing in spas and beauty chains where armies of nurses provide injections to much higher numbers of customers. In America private-equity investments in medical aesthetics grew by 30% per year between 2019 and 2021. Chains of investor-backed &#8220;medispas&#8221; have also popped up in Brazil and China. These often partner with digital influencers and give them free treatments in exchange for a post that tags the clinic, says Sonya Esman, a digital influencer based in Los Angeles. Thanks in part to such innovations, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (<small>ASPS</small>) reckons that average prices for hyaluronic-acid injections fell by $79 in 2023 (to $715) and for Botox by $93 (to $435). Sales have been growing rapidly (see chart).</p><figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250104_FBC283.png"></div></figure><p>Increasing numbers of people are also travelling abroad for touch-ups. The number of foreigners who visited Turkey for medical procedures, mostly plastic surgery, has ballooned like a bad implant, from 300,000 in 2013 to more than 1.5m last year. The country has become so popular for hair transplants, which involves grafting hair from the back of the head to the top or the front, that the national carrier is sometimes referred to as Turkish Hairlines. Price is the main draw. In Turkey a hair transplant costs $2,500 on average, compared with between $4,000 and $12,000 in Britain. In Brazil a nose job will set you back by around $2,000, compared with $7,600 in America.</p><p>Cheaper procedures with less downtime are making cosmetic treatments accessible to a broader audience. Plástica para Todos (Plastic for All), a Brazilian chain of plastic-surgery clinics founded in 2017, targets low-income workers. Patients can pay for surgeries in 100 instalments. The company runs adverts on Instagram where it boasts that getting plastic surgery can be cheaper than buying an iPhone. In Argentina one of the largest health-insurance providers offers a plan that includes one plastic surgery a year.</p><p>Millennials, in particular, have embraced the new, cheaper tweakments. Some two-thirds of the 20m people who booked treatments in 2018 on So-Young, the Chinese app, were born after 1990. By the same token, 27% of American patients receiving Botox in 2022 were 34 or younger, compared with a fifth in 2015 (the idea is to prevent wrinkles before they form). In South Korea a Gallup poll found that a quarter of Korean women in their 20s had had plastic surgery in 2020, compared with 5% in 1994. That makes it the record-holder for plastic surgeries per person. Even men are increasingly dabbling: they accounted for only 10% of the global market for anti-wrinkle injections in 2018, but 15% in 2021.</p><p>An unfortunate sign of the industry&#8217;s popularity is the number of charlatans it attracts. &#8220;People who are not trained are doing financial speculation on the human body,&#8221; laments Juvenal Frizzo, a plastic surgeon in São Paulo. Dr Frizzo and other plastic surgeons interviewed by <i>The Economist</i> say that growing numbers of patients are seeking help with botched filler treatments. These can range from the disfiguring, including faces that look like puffer fish, to the dangerous: in extreme cases, filler can migrate into the eyes or veins, leading to blindness, sepsis or skin necrosis. Operations are even more risky. Since 2019 at least 29 British patients have died in Turkey in botched cosmetic surgery.</p><p>Among rich countries, Britain stands out for its lax regulation. Whereas in America only doctors, dentists or nurses can administer injections, in Britain there is no national law stipulating any particular qualifications. Many practitioners take only short courses in person or online before starting to treat clients, often in premises not licensed or equipped for medical procedures. In September a British woman died after receiving a non-surgical butt lift (in which lots of filler is pumped into the buttocks) at a beautician&#8217;s home.</p><p>Some procedures test boundaries in other ways. Chelsea (not her real name), a 37-year-old estate agent in New York, spends over $30,000 a year on injectables. But much of it does not go on her face. &#8220;Everything that I do to my face, like Botox, filler or whatever, I also do to my vagina. But it hurts so badly that you have to, like, be on tranquil anaesthesia to do it.&#8221; She is one of 130,000 followers on Instagram of a plastic surgeon she calls &#8220;the vagina whisperer&#8221;. &#8220;By the way, there&#8217;s another doctor who&#8217;s doing designer assholes too, for guys,&#8221; she adds.</p><p>Social media give practitioners a way to advertise their specialisations online. &#8220;When I went into practice, plastic surgeons could hardly advertise,&#8221; says Gregory Mueller, who is based in Los Angeles and has been operating since 1998. Industry associations would discourage their members from advertising in newspapers or magazines or appearing on television, he says, for fear of undermining their professional credibility. Today some doctors have become celebrities in their own right, with millions of followers on TikTok and Instagram, where they show before-and-after photographs of patients to lure new clients. Some even live-stream operations.</p><p>Social media are also spurring a convergence in ideals of beauty around the world. Dr Devgan says that her patients increasingly have an &#8220;amalgamated beauty standard&#8221; which features &#8220;the fuller eyebrows of South Asia&#8221;, &#8220;the fuller lips of sub-Saharan [Africa]&#8221; and &#8220;a positive canthal tilt&#8221;, jargon for the upward-arching eyes typical of East Asians. Demand for procedures such as the &#8220;fox-eye&#8221;, in which threads are placed in the corners of the eyes to pull them upwards, have been touted in the West by models and celebrities. The popularity of the Brazilian butt lift is also part of this mishmash.</p><p>Gangnam, a posh district of Seoul, South Korea&#8217;s capital, may vie with Beverly Hills for the accolade of the most plastic-surgery clinics per square kilometre. Some 400 of them are crammed into 37km<sup>2</sup>. Its emergence as a rival pole to Los Angeles reflects the globalisation of the beauty industry. In East Asia the most popular procedure, double-eyelid surgery, initially arose from a desire to look more Western, says Tanimoto Naho, a sociologist at Kansai University in Japan. Today Japanese and Chinese women look to South Korea for inspiration, thanks to the popularity of Korean films and pop music.</p><figure class="media media--drawing media--wide"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250104_FBD002.png"></div></figure><p>The look of <small>K</small>-pop stars is &#8220;girly, cute and pretty&#8212;being too mature is bad&#8221;, says Leem So-yeon of Dong-A University in Busan. It involves few curves, a <small>V</small>-shaped face, giant animé-style eyes and a tiny nose. When Inuma Motoko, a 33-year-old Japanese beauty blogger, arranged her first plastic surgery during the pandemic, she contacted a medical-tourism agency in South Korea and travelled to Seoul. She has since undergone bone-shaving surgery, in which the jawbone is trimmed to produce a sharper jawline, and had the corner of her eyes cut open to make them look wider.</p><h3>A crass audience</h3><p>Many people undergo such grisly procedures because they believe that being perceived as attractive will lift their career and marriage prospects. Jin Hong-ryul, a plastic surgeon in Seoul, says the busiest time of year is after university entrance exams in November, when many parents reward their children for passing by buying them plastic surgery. Résumés in South Korea usually include headshots. Many parents believe that &#8220;to be successful, you should be attractive&#8221;, says Mr Jin. For models and influencers, whose income depends on the number of likes they receive on posts, the pressure is even greater.</p><p>Even those whose jobs do not depend on their appearance may feel pressure to enhance it. In a paper from 1993, Daniel Hamermesh of the University of Texas and Jeff Biddle of Michigan State University, found that &#8220;plain&#8221; workers suffer an earnings penalty of 5-10% and &#8220;good-looking&#8221; ones earn a premium of similar magnitude. Pretty waitresses get higher tips and advertising firms with good-looking executives win more lucrative contracts. This may not speak simply to the shallowness of bosses and customers: people who are considered beautiful may also do better because they are more self-confident.</p><p class="end has-stop">As long as the pretty privilege remains, so will the temptation to nip, tuck, lift and plump. Ms Chang, the Taiwanese beauty influencer, summarises the problem: &#8220;Plastic surgery is addictive&#8212;once you start, you keep going.&#8221; That should keep the business forever young. </p>
