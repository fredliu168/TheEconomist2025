          <figure class="media media--drawing media--wide"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250104_ASD000.png"></div></figure><p><span data-caps="initial">T</span><small>HE CRASH</small> of Jeju Air flight 2216 in South Korea captured the world&#8217;s imagination in the final days of 2024. The events leading to the loss of 179 souls&#8212;a bird strike followed by engine and perhaps landing-gear failure&#8212;seem terrifyingly random. &#8220;It could have been me&#8221; is a thought that doubtless passed through millions of minds. It will be months before the full story becomes clear, but such accidents usually end up being attributed to rare combinations of multiple factors. Investigations seek to unravel what happened; airlines and regulators then apply those lessons to make future flights safer. That approach has helped make flying the least dangerous mode of transport.</p><p>Yet there is one risk to air travellers that has grown in recent years. It is one that no amount of changes to aircraft design or pilot training or bird-noise machines can reduce. And it is becoming ever more urgent. It is the risk of passenger aircraft being shot out of the sky, and it disproportionately affects routes between Asia and Europe, Africa and the Middle East.</p><p>On December 25th Azerbaijan Airlines flight 8243 was on a regular service from Baku, in Azerbaijan, to Grozny in Russia&#8217;s Chechnya region. It never made it. The aircraft instead plummeted to the ground on the shores of the Caspian in Kazakhstan, killing 38 people. At the time of the incident, says Russia, Grozny was under attack from Ukrainian drones. The evidence points to an accidental shootdown by Russian air defences. In another accident, on December 22nd an American warship shot down an American fighter jet over the Red Sea.</p><p>The frequency of such events is growing. Four commercial aircraft have been downed by missiles this century: Siberia Airlines flight 1812 was shot down by Ukraine over the Black Sea in 2001. Thirteen years later Malaysia Airlines flight 17 was brought down by Russian-backed separatists over eastern Ukraine. Six years after that, Iran shot down Ukraine International Airlines flight 752 as it took off from Tehran. The Azeri plane came to grief just five years later.</p><p>A broad slice of the world is mired in conflict. Wars in the Middle East involve Israel, Iran, Lebanon and the Houthi rebels in Yemen. Their missile exchanges also affect airspace over Iraq, Jordan, Syria and the Arabian peninsula, rendering a wide swathe of the Middle East vulnerable. To the north, Ukraine&#8217;s airspace is closed while Russia&#8217;s is subject to regular incursions by Ukrainian missiles and drones. The skies above Sudan, too, are closed to commercial traffic and many airlines avoid flying over Libya. The Red Sea is bristling with warships. With Russian airspace off-limits to Western airlines, much of the air traffic between Asia and regions to the west of it is squeezing into fewer available routes.</p><p>In October a passenger on an Emirates flight from Amsterdam to Dubai filmed missile launches from her window when over Iran. In the early hours of December 31st Russia downed 68 &#8220;military-grade weaponised drones&#8221;, forcing the diversion of at least five flights, according to Matthew Borie of Osprey Flight Solutions, an aviation risk-management company. Another catastrophe is a matter of when and not if.</p><p>There are no easy fixes to the problem. The Convention on International Civil Aviation, to which every country on Earth, except Liechtenstein, is a signatory, already requires countries to &#8220;refrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight&#8221;, and to promptly communicate potential risks posed by conflict. Both civil and military aircraft have transponders that answer ground-based queries, revealing whether they are &#8220;friend or foe&#8221;.</p><p>But these systems are less effective in modern conflicts. Electronic warfare can mask such signals, leaving air-defence forces guessing about the identities of the planes above them. The use of drone swarms, along with cruise and ballistic missiles, fills the skies with dangerous objects. And the idea that Russia and Ukraine, or Israel and the Houthis, would issue airspace-closure warnings before launching missiles at each other is a non-starter.</p><p class="end has-stop">What can be done? One answer is for Ukraine and Russia to make peace, Israel and its neighbours to get along, Sudan to wind down its bloody civil war and Libya to unfail. Another is for airlines to be braver about cancelling or rerouting flights based on real-time intelligence, even at the risk of annoying passengers and driving up fares. Neither answer offers much reassurance.</p>
