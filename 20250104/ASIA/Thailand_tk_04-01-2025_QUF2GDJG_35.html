          <p><span data-caps="initial">I</span><small>T IS NOT</small> for nothing that Thailand is called the Detroit of South-East Asia. In its heyday the country built a car-export powerhouse by combining Japanese auto-making know-how with a competitive network of Thai car-parts suppliers. It is still South-East Asia&#8217;s biggest carmaker. Yet the production lines are not thrumming as they once did. On November 25th the Federation of Thai Industries, a trade group, said the country&#8217;s annual car output would probably sag to 1.5m units in 2024, 18% lower than in 2023 and 39% down from peak production a decade ago. Suzuki and Subaru, two Japanese carmakers, are closing down factories in Thailand.</p><p>Partly this stems from a tough market. <small>EV</small>s built by Chinese firms in Thailand have elbowed out Japanese competitors, which tend to rely more on Thai parts suppliers. But the bigger culprit is stifling household indebtedness, which has climbed ever higher since 2011, when the government launched a tax rebate for first-time car- and homebuyers. Thai households carry debt worth 92% of the country&#8217;s <small>GDP</small>, a bit shy of the 99% ratio America reached in 2007 (see chart).</p><figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250104_ASC223.png"></div></figure><p>It is not just the car market that is struggling. Silver linings in Thailand&#8217;s economy are becoming increasingly hard to find. Growth is meagre. Thailand&#8217;s working-age population began contracting in 2018, and the rate of shrinkage is accelerating. High household debt is hurting consumers by diverting income towards repayments: private consumption has stopped growing and consumer confidence is low.</p><p>The Bank of Thailand (<small>BOT</small>) will struggle to fix this. In October the central bank lowered interest rates to 2.25%, surprising economists; further cuts could reduce interest payments for households. But that would risk weakening the baht, which is already under pressure, given the gap between Thai rates and those set by America&#8217;s Federal Reserve. The <small>BOT</small> is also reluctant to lower rates much further, lest it be left without monetary-policy ammo during a crisis, says Chitchanok Annonjarn at the Asian Development Bank.</p><p>Political instability has not helped. In August Srettha Thavisin, then the prime minister, was removed by Thailand&#8217;s constitutional court. One veteran Asia private-equity investor (not usually the type to be scared) says Thailand offers the worst of both worlds: high political risk in a low-reward economy. On top of all this the country&#8217;s long-term competitive position is in doubt. Despite a recent bounce in exports, Thai export industries, which make up two-thirds of <small>GDP</small>, are dominated by old-school firms selling into shrinking markets. Thailand assembles the bulk of the world&#8217;s hard-disk drives. Attempts to pivot to more innovative product lines, such as the manufacturing of semiconductors, are only now ramping up.</p><p class="end has-stop">Since a military coup in 2014 halted its economic integration with the world, Thailand &#8220;has lost a lot of time&#8221;, says Miguel Chanco of Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy. Competitors like Vietnam spent the decade since then inking trade deals with South Korea and the <small>EU</small>. By contrast, talks on a Thailand- <small>EU</small> free-trade deal were revived only in 2021. </p>
