          <p>Donald Trump announced and then postponed punitive <b>tariffs</b> of 25% on goods from Canada and Mexico. The American president is using the threat of tariffs to press both countries to stop the flow of migrants and fentanyl across the border. He granted a 30-day reprieve following urgent talks with Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico&#8217;s president, and Justin Trudeau, Canada&#8217;s prime minister. Both leaders promised to boost their border security. Both had earlier vowed to retaliate with tariffs of their own on American products. The European Union said it would also retaliate after Mr Trump said he would &#8220;definitely&#8221; impose tariffs on <small>EU</small> imports over America&#8217;s trade deficit with the region. Global markets shuddered.</p><h3>The phoney war</h3><p>Mr Trump did impose extra tariffs of 10% on <b>Chinese imports</b>. China responded with limited duties on a range of American goods, tighter export controls on critical minerals and an antitrust investigation into Google, which has little presence in China. Its muted response raised hopes that the two sides will negotiate.</p><p>The tremors from the political earthquake in Washington spread to the <b>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</b>, a watchdog that the Republicans have wanted to abolish ever since its creation after the global financial crisis of 2007-09. Donald Trump dismissed Rohit Chopra as head of the bureau and Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary, took over as acting director. Mr Bessent immediately put the <small>CFPB&#8217;</small>s investigations and proceedings on hold.</p><p>The chief executive of <b>Hewlett Packard Enterprise</b>, Antonio Neri, said his company would fight the Justice Department&#8217;s attempt to block its $14bn acquisition of <b>Juniper Networks</b>. The department&#8217;s lawsuit claims the takeover would reduce competition in the market for networking equipment, but Mr Neri said its reasoning is flawed. The deal has already been approved in Britain and the <small>EU.</small></p><figure class="media media--chart media--narrow"><div><img class="media__image" src="images/20250208_WWC606.png"></div></figure><p>The share price of <b>Palantir</b> surged to a new high, after the data-analytics company produced a bumper set of earnings and described demand for its artificial-intelligence software as &#8220;untamed&#8221;. The company focuses primarily on the defence industry and has benefited from the election of Mr Trump. Alex Karp, the <small>CEO,</small> described the new government&#8217;s cost-cutting drive as a &#8220;revolution&#8221;, which would benefit Palantir because of its data-crunching expertise.</p><p>By contrast, <b>Alphabet&#8217;s</b> stock sank after its quarterly earnings disappointed investors. Revenue from its cloud business grew by 30%, year on year, but this was less than the 35% in the previous quarter. Alphabet suggested it didn&#8217;t have the capacity to meet demand. It also anticipated investing $75bn on data centres this year, up from $53bn last year.</p><h3>What market rout in AI?</h3><p>Open<small>AI</small> and SoftBank announced a venture that will develop <small>AI</small> across the Japanese conglomerate&#8217;s subsidiaries. SoftBank is investing $3bn a year in the project, named <b>Cristal Intelligence</b>. Its aim is to create <small>AI</small> agents for &#8220;knowledge work&#8221; that will automate mundane tasks, such as generating financial reports and managing customer inquiries. It will also be marketed to other companies in Japan. Masayoshi Son, SoftBank&#8217;s boss, said he now believes that the ability of <small>AI</small> to match or surpass humans across a range of cognitive tasks will happen much sooner than he had predicted.</p><p>The release of &#8220;Moana 2&#8221; and &#8220;Mufasa: The Lion King&#8221; helped <b>Disney&#8217;s</b> earnings come roaring back to life in the last three months of 2024. Operating income at the company&#8217;s entertainment division, which includes films, grew by 95% in the quarter, year on year. Revenue from streaming was up by 9%. &#8220;Inside Out 2&#8221;, &#8220;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&#8221; and &#8220;Moana 2&#8221; were the top three box-office hits worldwide in 2024.</p><p>Quarterly revenue and profit at <b>UBS</b> came in above market expectations, which the Swiss bank said was a result of strong demand from institutional and private clients following the election of Mr Trump. It warned, however, that its plans for a $3bn share buy-back could be derailed by possible higher capital requirements in Switzerland.</p><p><b>UPS</b> announced that it was reducing the amount of shipments it handles from Amazon by 50% so that it can focus on more profitable business. The <small>US</small> Postal Service recently adjusted its fees, shaking up the economics of parcel deliveries. We are &#8220;taking control of our destiny&#8221;, said Carol Tomé, the chief executive, before <small>UPS&#8217;</small>s share price sank by almost 15%.</p><p class="has-stop"><b>Spotify</b> reported its first annual profit since launching in 2008. The music and podcast streaming platform now has 675m monthly active users.</p>
