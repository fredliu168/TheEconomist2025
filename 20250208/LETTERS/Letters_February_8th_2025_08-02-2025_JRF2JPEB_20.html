        <section class="article__body">
          <h3>Airport slots</h3><p>Bagehot (January 25th) quoted the International Air Transport Association&#8217;s statement that airport slot auctions would be a &#8220;disaster&#8221; without explaining why this would be so. Unlike economic theories of why market-based auctions would be better for slots, we prefer to rely on real-world experience. When slot auctions were tried in China they further entrenched incumbent airlines, only at a greater cost, which had to be passed on to consumers.</p><p>Moreover, the analogy between airport slots and radio spectrum is false because Britain&#8217;s aviation system does not exist in a bubble. Airports must connect internationally, and that requires a common set of rules and standards. In reality, the current slot regulations allow for a free, fair and transparent allocation of scarce capacity. In doing so, they have enabled more access for successful airlines while rightly setting a high performance bar if airlines are to retain their slot privileges.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>WILLIE WALSH</small></div><div class="letter-info__title">Director-general</div><div class="letter-info__organisation">International Air Transport Association</div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Geneva</i></div></div><h3>Defining an oligarchy</h3><p>It is not true that Russian big businesses, or &#8220;oligarchs&#8221;, do not compete with each other (Schumpeter, January 25th). Even now they compete in fields such as banking, oil, steelmaking, construction and information technology. In 2004, Schumpeter&#8217;s reference point, which is roughly the period when Russia could conceivably be characterised as an oligarchy, competition was fiercer than it is now.</p><p>Vladimir Putin&#8217;s Russia today is not an oligarchy. It is a personalist autocracy in which big businesses are completely subordinated to the strongman at the top. In fact, the way captains of American tech are currently queuing to bribe Donald Trump with policy tweaks and, amazingly, literal cash donations bears an uncanny resemblance to the behaviour of Russian billionaires in the early 2000s. Which makes me think that, indeed, America is not at risk of becoming a big-tech oligarchy, but only because it is choosing a much darker Putinesque path.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>DR MIKHAIL TAMM</small></div><div class="letter-info__organisation">Russian researcher in exile</div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Tallinn, Estonia</i></div></div><h3>Africa&#8217;s microbusinesses</h3><p>Your special report in the January 11th issue diagnosed well the challenges of running a business of any size in Africa. There is no doubt that Africa needs more large businesses to increase productivity. But your dismissal of microenterprises does a disservice to the many small, informal enterprises that are currently an important economic engine in much of the continent.</p><p>According to America&#8217;s Small Business Administration, 99.9% of firms in the United States are small and micro businesses, accounting for 46% of private-sector employment and generating 61% of net new jobs between 1995 and 2023. The contributions of small and microenterprises are similar in the European Union.</p><p>This is a critically important dynamic. Across Africa, far too many people, especially women, are relegated to subsistence farming, inhibiting their ability to earn a sustainable income and move up the economic ladder. In a low-income country such as Uganda smallholder farmers make up more that half the population. Countries like this need the opportunities offered by both large and small firms to provide jobs and growth. But firms of all sizes are inhibited by the absence of affordable capital, electricity and other infrastructure, as you rightly pointed out.</p><p>Although Africa does indeed need more large firms, the problem isn&#8217;t necessarily too many microenterprises. It is too little opportunity for people, including women, to move from subsistence farming into any sector, including as owners of small businesses, which will continue to be the backbone of African economies.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>GRETA BULL</small></div><div class="letter-info__title">Director, Women&#8217;s Economic Empowerment</div><div class="letter-info__organisation">Gates Foundation</div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Seattle</i></div></div><h3>Towers of strength</h3><p>It was great to see your article about the health benefits of strength training as you get older (&#8220;Should you start lifting weights?&#8221;, January 18th). But one problem with lifting weights is that it is boring. Rock climbing is a better alternative. Finger, arm, leg, foot and core muscles are all involved. And climbing requires mental focus, strategic thinking and persistence, all of which enhance a person&#8217;s cognitive abilities as they age. It is also fun and a social sport, practised worldwide. And with the proliferation of indoor climbing gyms a person doesn&#8217;t need to venture into the wilds in search of natural crags. I am 66. Our family was lucky to have discovered this sport 30 years ago and we all hope to continue climbing well into our advanced years.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>TERRY MCCOLL</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>North Vancouver, Canada</i></div></div><h3>Why societies are dishonest</h3><p>&#8220;A nation of polite liars&#8221; (January 18th) reported on how Britain is becoming a well-mannered but deceitful society. In the 1990s I helped promote a yearly magazine article about which city in Europe was the most honest. In a very unscientific survey, editors would drop wallets in a given European city and then tally up the number that were returned. Helsinki was a winner one year.</p><p>I thought of that simple exercise when I read your article. The moral implications of cheating were not explored at all. Instead, you focused on things like the lack of control over the internet and social media and the government&#8217;s behaviour during the pandemic. But what about the loss of institutional importance, such as churches and civic organisations, and the sordid example of some of our elected leaders who prevaricate with abandon. With fewer opportunities for teaching and promoting role models the moral high ground is now just a slippery slope.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>MICHAEL FANNING</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Charlotte, North Carolina</i></div></div><p>In the mid-1940s George Orwell asserted that the English were unusually upstanding, you say. I can pinpoint when the fall occurred. In 1966 the World Cup was stolen from a hall that was also being used by Methodists. Fortunately, it was later recovered by a dog named Pickles. At least British pets have remained trustworthy.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>MARK YEOMANS</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Regina, Canada</i></div></div><h3>The corporate ladder</h3><p>Following the letters (January 25th) in response to Bartleby&#8217;s piece on hierarchy in the office, I remember my late husband&#8217;s experience at Shell. There the aim was to qualify for what was known as &#8220;tray and drapes&#8221;. It meant your coffee was brought to you on a tray and you had curtains at your window. My husband left Shell before he had aspired to such dizzy heights.</p><div class="letter-info"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>ANNE SMITH</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>London</i></div></div><p>Bartleby&#8217;s original column (January 11th) mentioned the challenges of choosing the right seat in relation to the boss at a meeting as a means of establishing one&#8217;s place in a hierarchy. Perhaps the Gospels provide some guidance on this. To paraphrase Luke 14:7-11, when you are invited, go and sit down at the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he may say to you, &#8220;Friend, move up higher&#8221;; then you will be honoured in the presence of all who sit at the table with you. For all who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.</p><div class="letter-info has-stop"><div class="letter-info__name"><small>MIKE DANAGHER</small></div><div class="letter-info__location"><i>Ottawa, Canada</i></div></div>
