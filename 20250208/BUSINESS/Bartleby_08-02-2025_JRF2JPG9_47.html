Welcome to Frostings. How may I help you?</p><p>Good morning! I&#8217;m here for a meeting with Victor Rumbaba.</p><p>Is he expecting you?</p><p>He is indeed.</p><p>Let me just check on the system for you. Can you spell Rhubarb for me?</p><p>Er, sure. <small>R.H.U.B.A.R.B.</small></p><p><i>Typing</i></p><p>I&#8217;m afraid that&#8217;s not coming up on the system. Can you spell his name again?</p><p>Oh, I&#8217;m sorry. I thought you were testing my spelling for some reason. That&#8217;s <small>R.U.M.B.A.B.A.</small></p><p><i>Typing</i></p><p>There he is. I&#8217;m afraid there is no record of him expecting guests this morning, so I will need to take your details. Can I have some <small>ID</small>, please?</p><p>Of course. Here you go.</p><p>That&#8217;s a gym-membership card.</p><p>Oh sorry. Hold on. Here&#8217;s my licence.</p><p>Thank you, Ms Genoise.</p><p><i>Typing</i></p><p>What company are you from?</p><p>Battenberg.</p><p><i>Typing</i></p><p>Can you look into the camera?</p><p>Sure.</p><p>That&#8217;s actually my water bottle.</p><p>I&#8217;m so sorry. Everything here looks like it could be a device.</p><p>The camera is just here.</p><p>I&#8217;m so sorry.</p><p>Just stand back a bit. You don&#8217;t need to be quite so close. Not quite so far. That&#8217;s it. Thank you.</p><p><i>Printer whirrs</i></p><p>Hold on a second. We&#8217;ve run out of stickers for the visitor passes. I&#8217;ll just radio my colleague. Alpha Bravo Windowcleaner, come in.</p><p>Tango Lemonade Delta. Receiving you loud and clear. Over.</p><p>Alpha Bravo Windowcleaner, we need stickers for the visitor passes. Do you know where they are? Over.</p><p>Tango Lemonade Delta, in the cabinet on the left. The one with the crisps. Over.</p><p>Wilco. Over and Out. Let me just load this up for you, Ms Genoise, and we&#8217;ll get it printed off.</p><p><i>Tray-opening. Grunting. Printing</i></p><p>Right. Here&#8217;s your pass.</p><p>Is this <small>OK</small>? I&#8217;m just a silhouette on this, you would have no idea it&#8217;s me.</p><p>Don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;ve worked here for 23 years and no one ever looks at the photo.</p><p>Why do you need one then?</p><p>Protocol. Just stick it somewhere on your jacket. I&#8217;ll call up to let Mr Rumbaba know that you are here.</p><p><i>Pushing of buttons</i></p><p>I&#8217;m afraid no one is picking up. Let me leave a message. Hello, this is reception. I have Mildred Genoise waiting for you.</p><p>Does anyone ever pick up?</p><p>Not any more. I&#8217;m not even sure people have phones on their desks up there. I sometimes think I might as well be sending interstellar messages to aliens.</p><p>So what happens now?</p><p>I send him an email saying exactly the same thing.</p><p><i>Typing</i></p><p>Does that work any better?</p><p>No.</p><p><i>A cough from behind</i></p><p>Mildred? It&#8217;s me. Victor.</p><p>Oh hello! We were just trying to get hold of you.</p><p>Yes, sorry. I was coming from another meeting outside the building and thought it must be you.</p><p>No problem.</p><p>Well, one problem actually. <i>Turns to reception.</i> Hello. I left my pass at home. Could you let us in?</p><p>I&#8217;m afraid not. I&#8217;ll need to get someone to vouch for you.</p><p>Really? We&#8217;ve been on silent-nodding terms for years.</p><p>Really. Can you give me the name of a colleague to call?</p><p>Er, yes. Try Sam Bundt.</p><p><i>Sound of someone pushing buttons.</i></p><p>No one is picking up. I&#8217;ll leave a mess age. Hello, this is reception. Can you come down to vouch for someone who has lost their pass?</p><p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t have phones on our desks. I&#8217;ll WhatsApp Sam.</p><p><i>Texting sounds</i></p><p>Success! He&#8217;s on his way.</p><p>I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll still need to sign in, Mr Rumbaba.</p><p>Really? Why?</p><p>Protocol. My colleague won&#8217;t let you through those barriers without a pass. Who are you here to see?</p><p>No one. I&#8217;m the person being visited.</p><p>Hmmm. This could be a problem.</p><p>Do you ever worry that your job might be taken over by a computer?</p><p class="end has-stop">I don&#8217;t think so. You can&#8217;t really replace the human touch, can you?</p>
