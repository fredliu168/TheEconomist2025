        <section class="article__body">
          <p><span data-caps="initial">E</span><small>VERYONE KNOWS</small> a genius when they see one. At least they do in biopics. In &#8220;A Complete Unknown&#8221;, a young Bob Dylan rocks up at the hospital that is treating Woody Guthrie, and instantly Guthrie and Pete Seeger, another folk-music patriarch, recognise he is the real deal. In &#8220;Maria&#8221;, even a sweating Nazi officer in wartime Athens, for whom a callow Maria Callas is forced to sing, gawps at her talent.</p><p>&#8220;A Complete Unknown&#8221; is up for eight Oscars. &#8220;Maria&#8221;, another new release, stars Angelina Jolie as the troubled diva. Along with &#8220;Better Man&#8221;, in which Robbie Williams is portrayed by a <small>CGI</small> ape, these are the latest in a drumbeat of musical biopics. Last year it was Amy Winehouse and Bob Marley. Up soon are a quartet of films about the Beatles (an impending Michael Jackson biopic has reportedly run into legal woes). Why is this genre playing on repeat?</p><p>Celebrity is a narrative shortcut. Like modern myths, the outlines of stars&#8217; biographies are familiar, so artful directors can focus on dramatic episodes, rather than squishing a whole life into two hours. You know Mr Dylan is a great American bard and Callas was an opera legend. So James Mangold can concentrate in &#8220;A Complete Unknown&#8221; on Mr Dylan&#8217;s breakthrough in the early 1960s. In &#8220;Maria&#8221; Pablo Larraín zooms in on the week before Callas&#8217;s death in 1977, with flashbacks to her wartime trials, glory days and affair with Aristotle Onassis.</p><p>Meanwhile viewers enjoy two performances in one. They see the screen Dylan shake up American music. In parallel they weigh up Timothée Chalamet&#8217;s impersonation, comparing his version of Mr Dylan&#8217;s oddly winning whine and enigmatic air with the original. Mr Chalamet pulls off this high-wire act with élan. For her part Ms Jolie suggests Callas&#8217;s imperious vulnerability.</p><p>The music itself is another draw. Musical biopics are, well, musicals. Not only do you get Mr Chalamet&#8217;s fine renditions of &#8220;Blowin&#8217; in the Wind&#8221; and &#8220;Like a Rolling Stone&#8221;; you imagine you are present at the creation of these anthems. You may not have heard Callas sing live, but &#8220;Maria&#8221; teleports you to her breakout triumph in &#8220;I Puritani&#8221; in 1949.</p><p>So a musical career is an efficient storytelling vehicle. It is also inherently dramatic, not just in the artist&#8217;s rise from obscurity but in the act of performance itself: the countdown to a headliner&#8217;s entrance, the audience&#8217;s caprice, the fortune-and-glory stakes. The climax of &#8220;A Complete Unknown&#8221; is the Newport Folk Festival of 1965 where Dylan scandalously &#8220;goes electric&#8221; and defects to rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll. In &#8220;Maria&#8221;, an ailing Callas tries in secret to revive her faded voice.</p><p>At the heart of the musical biopic is a mystery. Genius may be easy to spot, but where does it come from? In &#8220;Maria&#8221;, Callas reckons &#8220;music is born of misery&#8221;; you yank it &#8220;through your belly, out your poor mouth&#8221;. Ouch! &#8220;A Complete Unknown&#8221; dodges the question. Dylan blows into New York from Minnesota with the gift for lyrics that would ultimately win him a Nobel prize, plus an intuitive sense that &#8220;you have to kind of be a freak&#8221; to hold a crowd. His only explanation is a cock-and-bull yarn about performing at carnivals.</p><p>With the drama and insights, musical biopics typically have a dark undertone. After all, stardom is not all growing your hair wild and wearing shades indoors, as the movie Dylan does. Fame is a prize but it can also be a torment. The famous must wrestle for control of their stories with managers, record labels and, in Callas&#8217;s case, domineering partners. &#8220;Maria&#8221; imagines her telling John F. Kennedy that they are both &#8220;lucky angels who can go anywhere we want in the world&#8212;but we can never get away&#8221;.</p><p>This is the flipside of celebrity and of the biopic&#8217;s appeal. The star is an idol and a sacrifice, an object of both admiration and envy. When people ask where his songs came from, says the film Dylan bitingly, they really want to know &#8220;why the songs didn&#8217;t come to them&#8221;. Lots of biopics supply a shiver of <i>Schadenfreude</i> alongside devotion, in finales featuring anguish or untimely demise. Think of Elvis Presley, who in &#8220;Elvis&#8221; (2022) winds up bloated and exploited.</p><p class="end has-stop">In &#8220;Maria&#8221;, Callas swoons and dies as operatic heroines tend to. By contrast, Dylan evades the Icarus-like comeuppance that is a ghoulish element in the biopic formula, riding off on his motorbike into a wide-open future. The refusal to conform to type is part of the real Mr Dylan&#8217;s greatness&#8212;and a reason why &#8220;A Complete Unknown&#8221; stands out in one of cinema&#8217;s favourite genres.</p>
